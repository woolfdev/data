If [strike]words come,[/strike] [strike]they come[/strike] of themselves.
There was the story of the bear on the Himalayan pass - [strike]Mr.[/strike]
he
[strike]Carmichael[/strike]
had twiddled his thumbs. So with his acrostics,
with his poetry:
he did not hurry himself: if words ca[strike]o[/strike]me
work
they ca[strike]o[/strike]me.
What good [strike]poe[/strike] [strike]writing[/strike] has ever been done in a hurry?

Mr. Carmichaels bedroom,

Carmichael proceeded, sinking into his arm chair. (He
translated Persian) & his eyes, fixed blandly upon the sky
watch
the flight of words
seemed to [strike]gaze[/strike] await contentedly, as a cat will

at last a word came his way; & he set it down, completed
[strike]another of those stanzas which[/strike] & had no doubt that these
at all
stanzas, which he translated from the Persian, were
long, so infinitely by
destined to endure so [strike]many centuries[/strike] that the [strike]lapse of[/strike] years
he [strike]spent in[/strike] [strike]the months he spent making them were mere[/strike]

And if there were
other ways,
other ways
of life than this, he saluted them; if there were
men [strike]?of more active[/strike]
other views, he only prayed them to pass
him by, as slipping upstairs he craved of that
kind lady Mrs. Ramsay
that she should not
in making it
require him to stop
& talk to her, for in such
matters he was inadequate,
he knew. As for
wasting his own meagre opportunities (for compared
with many men he knew himself to be of little account)
[strike]his[/strike] he was not [strike]at all[/strike] inclined

   Like all daughters,
Prue & Nancy knew what was passing in
their father's
[strike]their father's mind[/strike] [strike]Mr. Ramsay's[/strike] mind: felt his irritation; knew
the cause of it, but
with this difference between them - Prue was
the ?great
eighteen, & therefore already [strike]admitted[/strike] a member of [strike]that[/strike] [strike]great[/strike]
corporation, grown up people; so that she desired [strike]harmony[/strike] above all
harmony
things, Nancy was sixteen; & therefore still [strike]detached[/strike]
outside [strike]of all[/strike] groups & societies; [strike]lit [?][/strike] [strike]detached & aloof,[/strike] so
[strike]that if she[/strike] so that she desired of all things freedom. & could
not restrain herself, seeing her father scowl, seeing Mr.
Carmichael tuck his napkin in & spoon up soup, [strike]afresh,[/strike]
from [strike]such[/strike] a spasm of delight of merriment, of criticism (for
why were old people so absurd?) as shook her, & would
shake all the children, Mrs. Ramsay knew. [strike]They[/strike] They would
all burst out laughing [strike]she[/strike]. [strike][?][/strike] [strike]So[/strike] [strike]why not light the candles?[/strike]
   [strike]Fetch[/strike] Light the candles, she said promptly, adding
at the
of amazement
at the astonishing
antics of the [strike]?wo[/strike]
old
how dark it was getting; & Nancy, Roger jumping up
simultaneously exploded by the side board, & then, to make up,
lit the candles with the greatest assiduity; showing themselves
most eager, most indefatigable in this matter; so that
the eight white candles were soon lit, & their shades
stood upright
adjusted, & after the first stoop of the flames, they burnt [strike]up[/strike]
again & seemed to draw with them up into visibility
[strike]the whole of[/strike] the long table, & in particular [strike]Ros[/strike]

[strike]dish of fruit in the centre.[/strike] the pinks the yellows the

had she done with it, Mrs. Ramsay wondered,
inspecting [strike]the[/strike] Rose's arrangement; of grapes & pears; - how
horny
they were built up about a pinklipped
shell, so as to
have the effect of some trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea &
[strike]Fruits of the sea, Neptune's banquet, the[/strike]

her
[strike]things, but[/strike] of fruits of the sea,
of Neptune's banquet, of the

[strike]of the Bacchus - in short of nothing[/strike] -
of the bunch that hangs over the shoulder of Bacchus, [strike]or is[/strike] among
lion skins leopard skins & torches wavering [strike]gol[/strike] red & gold.
It was odd, Mrs. Ramsay thought - her power [strike]of[/strike] with her hands; &
[strike]?Th[/strike] [strike]pr[/strike] in her pride, she saw how Mr. Carmichaels eyes
feasted like bees upon the sight, plunged themselves into it, &
broke this &
that from it
returned from it laden with gold [strike]to his hive;[/strike] [strike]to make money from,[/strike]
[strike]while she[/strike] [strike]& all[/strike] For now they were all lit up; - the

faces on either side of the table had all been brought nearer
in the candle light; & composed, as they had not been in the
twilight, into a party round a table; while [strike]outside[/strike]
was
the night [strike]was outside;[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] separated off by panes of glass which
far from giving any accurate view of the hedge, or of the
urns, [strike]changed them, &[/strike] rippled them strangely so that it seemed as
in the midst of

on an island
if, safe & dry the company sat at table, surrounded by
[strike]wavering[/strike] waters sprinkled with lights.
[strike]It is[/strike]
   It has [strike]suddenly[/strike] become unreal, thought Lily Briscoe,
trying to account for the feeling of exhilaration which had
taken possession of them; & thinking how it was [strike]partly[/strike]
like the scene on the tennis lawn [strike]over[/strike] again, [strike]& was[/strike]
when they were all so light hearted, & was partly due to the
[strike]queer lighting[/strike] - [strike]these[/strike] little candles in the large, sparely
&
?[strike]soft[/strike] bright
furnished room, & the uncurtained windows;

pale green
?walls

of the lights, when in came - [strike]several things:[/strike] First Minta
Doyle; then Janet with a large earthenware pot; then
Paul Rayley; & then the [strike]little[/strike] Swiss girl, with [strike][?][/strike]
more dishes; [strike][/strike][strike]& Paul Rayley came & sat between her[/strike]
the candle

[strike]& Mrs. Ramsay, Minta Doyle,[/strike]
all of which had
to be set down, that is the dishes had
to be arranged;
Minta & Paul had to find their places (he between ?her ?&
Mrs. Ramsay; she beside Mr. Ramsay) & [strike]Minta[/strike]
they were both frightfully nervous.
   "Poor Minta lost her brooch" said
Mrs. Ramsay instantly.
9
   "Yes, my grandmother's brooch" said Minta, [strike]to[/strike] with a sound
of lament in her voice; & a suffusion of her large brown eyes which
[strike]in[/strike] roused all the chivalry in
Mr. Ramsays heart; so that he
he scolded her [strike]for being[/strike] [strike]dryly.[/strike]
   How could she be such a fool? he [strike]said[/strike] asked.
She was by way of being terrified of Mr. Ramsay
& he was moved by
the [strike]odd[/strike] lampit
love she had, her
glow, her
untidiness,
11
She was by way of being terrified of [strike]Mr. Ramsay.[/strike] He was so fearfully
clever. [strike]In truth, she got on with him beautifully, &[/strike] He made her
feel so common, she would say; [strike]& she had tried to talk about[/strike]
&
it terrified her to
be made to talk
to him,
especially as
[strike]George Eliot, whom he mentioned, but nervous of[/strike] having left
but
the third volume of Middlemarch in the Tube, [strike]could not[/strike]
[strike]a fact which she had never regretted until this moment, could not[/strike]

& [strike]now[/strike]
So that they
had to give ?up

[strike]a fool,[/strike] [strike]he called her a fool, she felt quite at her ease with him,[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]only[/strike] & [strike]knew that[/strike] [strike]only a little[/strike] & [strike]determined to[/strike] [strike]not much[/strike]
[strike]frightened, only enough to make it seem rather daring to[/strike]

[strike]she felt[/strike] what Lily Briscoe had never felt in the course of her life -
& thought she
felt
that [strike]every[/strike] round about her was a golden haze. She could not help it:
she could not alter it. Sometime she had it; sometimes not; [strike]or[/strike] but
knew that
to night she had it; she [strike]was awfully glad to think that[/strike] tonight
somehow so that
he spoke with that
the
curious tone ?wh
&
she had it; [strike]&[/strike] Mr. Ramsay felt it; & that when he said
within the
   How could you be such a fool?
he was under circle
not about
[strike]the spell[/strike] of her [strike]?g[/strike] golden gaze
She need scarcely speak;
George
Eliot
?of course
it did not
but [strike]or[/strike] any nonsense that came into her head.
Please, what had he
matter
been doing? [strike]What right had he to[/strike] [strike]Had he been virtuously[/strike]
[strike]occupied?[/strike] (for she could chatter to him any nonsense) [strike]Reading?[/strike]
How many pipes had he smoked?
It was a fact that
about
George Eliot,
Mr. Ramsay liked talking nonsense [strike]better than anything in the world[/strike]
+
for a time, with a young woman,
with a pretty young
not
quite
better than
woman, who, (but the distinction he made was [strike]not[/strike] [strike]by no means[/strike]
clear) [strike]looked[/strike] [strike]did her hair,[/strike] "didn't scrape her hair [strike]up[/strike]"; which
off
anything in the
world
Minta did not, but Lily Briscoe did; & that included
some thing flying, something even a little wild &
?into
bold & harumscarum
into the bargain.
There was some
quality, which Mrs. Ramsay
herself had not - some lustre, some
richness, some intemperance, which
attracted him: solaced
him; & led him to devise curious treats for these
15
13
favourites; they might cut his hair for him; plait him chains, or
interrupt his work, pulling him [strike]up[/strike] out of his chair to play at
croquet with them;
   Mrs. Ramsay knew it. At this very moment she felt it, &
asked herself how then it would have been if he had married one of
them - those girls she meant, with a certain golden-reddishness
about them, like Minta, whom she liked
too;
indeed she was
indeed
she was
not jealous; almost grateful to them,
for their
[strike]pulling[/strike] laughing at
him, till he seemed young & fiery & romantic;
[strike]no longer[/strike] &
not caustic; not [strike]w[/strike] burdened; not overcome
with the greatness of his
labours & the sorrows of the world & the [strike]failure, or[/strike]
precise degree of failure or success of his books;
but again, as she
had known him, at the beginning of life,
[strike]with his temper[/strike]
simple
gallant[strike]ry[/strike] & [strike]his simplicity[/strike]
For herself, she liked [strike]the[/strike]
her boobies - that was her
husband's name for young men
like Paul Rayley [strike]who were not brilliant;[/strike] [strike]but never[/strike]
[strike]pretended to be anything[/strike]
There was, she thought, beckoning
Paul to a seat beside her, something most charming about a
young man of twentysix,
[strike]& so who is not all nerves, & all[/strike]
He need not be brilliant.
[strike]She was not brilliant[/strike] She had
enough of brilliance.
And how unfair, & how absurd, & how
[strike]entirely lacking in commonsense examiners are, she[/strike]
sorry awfully sorry
whatever there was.
And he gave [strike]her a[/strike] [strike]flower[/strike]?
[strike]It was something common that grows on moors;[/strike]
flower
to call him stupid, she thought, as he took
beside her
to be so late
He would eat

found,
his place, awfully
A
& he pretended that he wanted her to name it; [strike]whereas,[/strike]
[strike]what had happened was that he[/strike]
though it was quite a common
flower.
[strike]We picked it for you,[/strike] he said; [strike]&[/strike] so she would
take it & keep it; [strike]& put it away among those[/strike] so it
W
   ?For [strike]what could one say?[/strike]
They had agreed
[strike]Yet[/strike] [strike]But he did[/strike] And yet when he saw
her, he felt he must
tell her, & so gave
her a flower he had
in his button hole.
Which he had meant to keep always.
[strike]But he instead[/strike] [strike]It was[/strike]
So she
took it.

instantly the token of
not to [u]say[/u] anything,
either of them, until they were alone
with Mrs. Ramsay.
[strike]something[/strike]
15
sat
[strike]how sorry[/strike] beside her, saying that he was sorry, awfully sorry, that they were late,
did not deserve any food, & so on.
But it was
   [strike]No sooner had he sat down than[/strike] [strike]it seemed[/strike] impossible [strike]that[/strike]

that she should not [strike]know[/strike] knew [strike]what had happened to him;[/strike] how, since lunch,
[strike]such a thing had[/strike] [strike]happened;[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] a thing had happened; [strike]which[/strike]
& it
he was changed; [strike]all[/strike]
was her doing; [strike]yet[/strike] [strike]"We[/strike]
   [strike]"A flower we found on the cliff"[/strike] he said, [strike]taking[/strike]
   We [strike]had to ?look go[/strike] went back to look for Minta's
really
wh
[strike]her[/strike]
[strike]Minta's[/strike] brooch," he said, &
really
[strike]as[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] [strike]said[/strike]
[strike]that[/strike] was [strike]quite[/strike] enough; [strike]as[/strike]
his tremor over
by [strike]the way[/strike]
[strike]for[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay [strike]to[/strike] knew then;
"we" [strike]went back;[/strike] & then
it cost him to say
the little effort the [strike]little hesitation[/strike] in saying Minta; she
[strike]knew then for certain, & having[/strike] & by [strike]the[/strike] especially by that
'we' which, she thought [strike]will[/strike] is the first time I have heard him
say it, & it seemed to her extremely moving on his lips "we",
that they were now
when it implied, as she knew it did, [strike]a[/strike] a lifetime
together, for life,
&
&
[strike]?implied[/strike] his care, his suffering -
She knew then [strike][?][/strike] [strike]exactly[/strike] what
speak
had happened, & how he could [strike]scarcely[/strike]
[strike]keep his eyes off[/strike]
[u]Minta[/u], [strike]or[/strike] & how the [strike]table[/strike] lights glittered
in his eyes; & how
how
everybody seemed to him a little unreal; &
[strike]an immense[/strike]
gratitude filled his heart.
[strike]But she must help them[/strike]
   [strike]But from the[/strike]
A [strike]fragrance rose from the great[/strike]
peering into the ?great
[strike]brown dish;[/strike]
But [strike]twisting & steaming[/strike]
an exquisite scent of
olives & oil & juice rose from the great brown dish; &
[strike]she peered into it &[/strike] & she must help them, ?considering that a
special portion should be [strike]kep[/strike] given [strike]her[/strike] to William Bankes;
Nobody would believe how much thought had gone to that dish
It had been stewed for three days & she thought as she peered into the
[strike]It[/strike] dish, with its shiny walls, & its confusion of savoury brown
& yellow
[strike]sweetness &[/strike] slabs
in [strike]which were bayleaves & port,[/strike] lying at the
bottom,

curious sense [strike]of celebrating an[/strike] rising in her of festivity, at once [strike]wild &[/strike]

[strike]wild &[/strike] freakishly [strike]& tender,[/strike] as if [strike]she[/strike] being a married woman, [strike]&[/strike] a
[strike]mother, she was[/strike] laughing while she [strike]cl[/strike] celebrated, [strike]there[/strike] as if
[strike]there[/strike] two emotions
collided in her, one profound - for

death & tragedy: at the same time,

time these ?lover

must be danced ?round
with mockery
& decorated
with
garlands of
[strike]flowers[/strike]
lovers, those [strike]entering into[/strike]

whom she would have to

   "It is a triumph" said William Bankes - It was delicious: it was
real
rich; it was tender; it was
[strike]thoughtful[/strike] cooking with skill & taste in it, not
up
merely serving
lumps of meat up [strike]roast[/strike] browned over.
How did she manage these things in the depths of the country?
he asked her?
She was a wonderful woman - he thought
receipt
is
It [strike]was[/strike] a French [strike]dish[/strike]", said Mrs. Ramsay. [strike]She was[/strike]
agreed
She [strike]felt[/strike] with Mr. Bankes, [strike]that[/strike] what passes for cookery in
England is [strike]simply[/strike] an abomination. It is putting
cabbage in water. [strike]It is[/strike] [strike]Then you throw away the water which[/strike]
[strike]It is[/strike] Stews, [strike]rice puddings[/strike] - "which can be [strike]d[/strike] so delicious in France -
all this tastes like leather & sawdust in England. After years &
years she had Roasting meat till it like shoe leather. Cutting
?Stewed
off the delicious skins of vegetables.
[strike]Every sin[/strike] Boiling, stewing,
so wasteful too
roasting, [strike]never anything else:[/strike]
& [strike]so wasteful[/strike] that a French family
can
[strike]could[/strike] [strike]easily[/strike] live, on what an English cook throws away.
Upon all this they were [strike]entirely[/strike] agreed: so strangely
19
They [strike]agreed. How happy she seemed, for[/strike] [strike]bein[/strike] [strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike] Her
exaggerations gave her a sense of extraordinary [strike]happiness.[/strike] happiness.
She was spurred on by some inner exhilaration: [strike]one[/strike]
English
said
   "Any little French Inn," she [strike]was saying[/strike] -
& Lily laughed at her. How childlike, how absurd - yes, Mrs. Ramsay was
overpowering. [strike]Sh[/strike] always she got her own way [strike]Its[/strike] Lily
thought that she had brought off this now - Paul & Minta were engaged -
& she was perfectly
happy.
[strike]& it seemed her doing.[/strike]
She put a spell on people. Why Lily
   [strike]"How did Minta[/strike] felt it - [strike]the[/strike] She felt Paul
Rayley sitting there [strike]silent;[/strike] under that spell; [strike]that[/strike] for it was
Mrs. Ramsay's doing that too - [strike]there[/strike] that deep, that inarticulate,
?glowing
that [strike]glowing[/strike] terrifying [strike]attractive[/strike] [strike]male[/strike] silence - [strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
[strike]exalted that; worshipped that; & acknowledged that as the[/strike]
[strike]light of life, its[/strike] & the way he kept looking across at Minta,
&
his tremor, his abstraction - Mrs. Ramsay sanctioned all
that, worshipped that, & would [strike]in her[/strike] having achieved
somehow laugh
that
[strike]proceed[/strike] to
lead her victims,
[strike]garlanded,[/strike] to the altar.
[strike]But Lily did feel it, herself:[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]she felt it really too much. She[/strike]
[strike]felt inconspicuous, insignificant,[/strike]
[strike]sitting beside Paul Rayley; &[/strike]
[strike]like a[/strike]
And she felt it herself.
She [strike]felt[/strike] [strike]more[/strike] emotionally
how inconspicuous she was by his side; he, glowing, burning;
she aloof, satirical; he bound for adventure; she moored to the
banks; he, in some way launched, incautious, given; & she
solitary & unillusioned; left out, [strike]unclaimed[/strike] - she was
ready to implore a share [strike]in his[/strike]
if it were disaster
in his disaster & said
   "How did Minta lose her brooch?"
She was repaid by the most exquisite smile; veiled
[strike]of course Paul Rayley knew;[/strike] by memory, tinged by dream,
for clearly
   [strike]But[/strike] I shall be up early & find it

But this was to be kept secret from Minta. so that he lowered

his eyes from [strike]that[/strike] where she sat, by Mr.
Ramsay
have
   Lily would have liked to [strike]have taken[/strike] vowed violently  believing
outrageously [strike]her[/strike] that she would
help him; [strike]only[/strike] hoping that
she would be the one, in the early dawn,
to light upon the brooch,
on the beach, & then be included among the
sailors &
adventurers, [strike]the[/strike] those who have
sacrificed, cast adrift, & [strike]gone[/strike]
hoisted their sails.
   But what did he reply to her offer? She actually said
come [?with]
with an emotion she seldom let appear,
[strike]Do[/strike] [strike]I[/strike] [strike]L[/strike]et me help you
[strike]&[/strike]
He laughed. [strike]Perhaps[/strike] he meant
yes or no - Either perhaps.
But
it was an odd chuckle. [strike]So[/strike] entirely regardless of her:
[strike]so[/strike] as if
he had said Throw yourself over the cliff if you like; [strike]as if[/strike]
[strike]he had said - Lily found herself veering violently away[/strike]
[strike][strike]again in the opposite direction[/strike][/strike]
turned the heat of love
upon her cheek, & scorched her, where she had seen only the
lovely
[strike]brilliant[/strike] flame: the
heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its
savagery
treachery, its
unscrupulosity.
Lily looked at Minta,
at the other end of the table;
being charming; [strike]be[/strike] in the centre of her [strike]golden haze,[/strike] &
[strike]could see her,[/strike] [strike]shrank for her,[/strike] trembled for her, exposed to the
heat of love;
this [strike]horror & this savagery.[/strike]
[strike]For it is awful, love;[/strike]
flower
What [strike]quite[/strike] like a deer gashed, or a
[strike]tree[/strike] felled; &
then, seeing the [strike]m[/strike] salt cellar, she remembered with a start,
[strike]how she was[/strike] to move the tree in her picture to the right:
she
[strike]thank Heaven, she breathed,[/strike] [strike]such an[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike] So escaped, & so so
need
rejoiced, & thanked God that she was not to
marry anybody even
Paul Rayley.
[strike]She had her painting. And the[/strike]
[strike]detestable passion,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]which the unscrupulous, the demented, the[/strike]
floods
but might paint. might escape
the [strike]horror[/strike] of brutality
which this estimable passion
lets loose upon the world,

Such was the complexity of things.
For what happened [strike]at the Ramsays[/strike] was
[strike]simply[/strike] Lily, [strike]especially[/strike] at
the Ramsays was to think
[strike]what she[/strike]
[strike]could not say,[/strike] [strike]Indeed[/strike]
it
two things at a time, one the opposite of the other,
as now; love is [strike]the[/strike]
beautiful, [strike]but [/strike]so
that I tremble on the verge of it
[strike]throwing myself into the flame;[/strike] but [strike]also despicable;[/strike]

Something [strike]she supposed[/strike] between the two - [strike]&[/strike]
she supposed; & luckily there was no compulsion upon her to
always

[strike]All her life[/strike] she would say [strike]one thing &[/strike]
what other

It was safer, simpler,
& so frightfully difficult to

   [strike]Mr.[/strike] [strike]"There is,[/strike] said Mr. Bankes, That liquid the English

the depths of her heart, & [strike]was[/strike] [strike]broug[/strike] led directly to
the allied but more [strike]agust[/strike] august questions of pure butter &
uncontaminated milk; [strike]as her sons & daughters were aware,[/strike]

[strike]with[/strike] charges [strike]when[/strike]

the table, beginning with Andrew,
in the middle, like a fire
[?]
25
which leaping from tuft to tuft of furze, her children laughed; her husband
laughed; she was laughed at, fire-encircled, & forced to [strike]va[/strike] vail her
crest, dismount her batteries & only retaliate by displaying the raillery
[strike]am[/strike] ridicule of the table to Mr. Bankes as [strike]the[/strike] an example of
what one suffered attacking the prejudices of the British
public.
she
Conveniently, for she had it on her mind that Lily
was out of things,
exempted her[strike], &[/strike] from the rest; claimed her an adherent; &
so drew her in[strike],[/strike]. [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]charming old maid, as Mr. Ramsay called[/strike]
[strike]c[/strike]Charming as she was, & exquisite in her own way too, with her
[strike]sa[/strike] little puckered up face & Chinese eyes,] She was out of things, Mrs.
Ramsay felt; so was Charles Tansley; both suffered from
comparison with the glow of the other [strike]two[/strike]. Both were aware of it,
she felt; [strike]while it made[/strike] Charles Tansley [strike]disagreeable, - quite[/strike]
[strike]naturally, it depressed her poor little Brisk, she[/strike] was all on
poor fellow
pins & needles.
No woman would look at him with Paul Rayley
in the room.
[strike]there.[/strike]
With Lily it was
different.
She faded; became more [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]more[/strike] inconspicuous than ever.
Yet, thought Mrs. Ramsay as
charming as she was
with her
little puckered
face & Chinese
eyes.
she claimed her help, [strike]in[/strike] (for Lily should bear her out that
she had not talked
about
butter & milk for at least three days;)
[strike]she is[/strike] of the two
Lily will wear better.
For there was in
a little flare of
Lily a [strike]sort of[/strike] thread of something; an angularity. [strike]a ch[/strike]
a [strike]quality[/strike] of character which in [strike]her[/strike] spite of everything Mrs.
Ramsay [strike]could not[/strike] liked, respected; though no man would.
Obviously not.
Unless it were an [strike]od[/strike] older man, like
William Bankes.
But then he cared, well, Mrs.
Ramsay thought sometimes
that he cared, now that his wife was
dead, more than any one for her.
27
Oh but nonsense, she thought. William shall marry Lily.
   Foolishly, she had set them opposite to each other. That could be remedied tomorrow.
Everything seemed possible. Everything seemed right. [strike]It seemed so[/strike]
Just now, (this cannot last, she thought) she hovered, like a hawk,
suspended; like a flag [strike]flutt[/strike] floating, in the element of
joy which filled every nerve in her body [strike]&[/strike] [strike]without[/strike]
fully & sweetly, [strike]&[/strike] not noisily, [strike]& th[/strike] [?] rather solemnly; for
did it not arise, partly, from [strike]the[/strike] solemn things? love of
husband, love of children, love of friends[strike],[/strike] ?
[strike]& not[/strike]
which
in this profound stillness (she was [strike]h[/strike] helping William Bankes to one
very small piece more[strike])[/strike] & peered into the depths of the ea
earthenware pot)
seemed, [strike]with[/strike] for no special reason, [strike]without a[/strike]
word said, or any [strike][/strike][strike][?] accident to bring it about,[/strike] in the ordinary
suddenly -
wonderfully
course of things to rise up, & [strike]become - Could one imagine such a[/strike]
[strike]thing - like a peal of silent bells; or the[/strike] like a smoke, an incense, or
a fume which being [strike]invisible &[/strike] imperceptible to the ordinary
senses [strike]one might[/strike] was for her with her dreading [strike]of ins[/strike] expression as [strike]shaded[/strike]
[strike]insincerity & words[/strike] [strike]sentimentality[/strike] & [strike]words are always one or[/strike]
[strike]the other[/strike] The insincerity, the sentimentality of words [strike]was for her[/strike]
divinely satisfactory; & partook, she felt, carefully helping Mr.
Bankes, of eternity, [strike]reminding her[/strike] was immune, like the past itself,
so solid &
entire it seemed
from change & glowed in the face of [strike][?][/strike] ruin [strike]&[/strike] a constant
jewel, so that here tonight was the heaven for such as her;
   Yes, she assured him, there was quite enough.
Andrew wanted more. -

lies [strike][?][/strike] close about the moon; [strike]the[/strike]
   [strike]And[/strike] [strike]moving[/strike] there [strike]with the since[/strike] She could move
or be at rest; could wait a moment, now that they were
all helped; & then like the hawk which lapses suddenly
from its high [strike]station[/strike] poise, flaunt & sink, on laughter,
easily, reposing her whole weight upon what at the other
29
end of the table her husband was saying about - was it square
roots, cubes, the numbers on tickets? [strike]And[/strike]
   Mrs. Ramsay did not know to this day what [strike]that[/strike] it meant:
but her husband did. Her sons did [strike]too[/strike]. She leant on their strength
Cubes & square roots & [strike]y[/strike] [strike]x[/strike] x plus y;

she let it
[strike]all[/strike] uphold her, & sustain her,
this admirable fabric of
[strike]beautiful[/strike] masculine intelligence
which ran up & down,


like iron girders [strike]which, without[/strike]
crossed this way & that, upheld the world:
[strike]Until[/strike] so that she
could trust herself to it utterly, &
even shut her eyes,
or blink them
&
dreaming

pillows at myriad ?layers of the leaves of a tree; & then, waking,
[strike]she would[/strike] there it was [strike]be[/strike] [strike]in[/strike] still being fabricated.
For
now
William Bankes was [strike]giving his opinion of the[/strike] [strike]pre[/strike] ?prasing;
Waverley novels; & springing to his feet, metaphorically,
rejoicing at this chance of assering his existence, Charles Tansley
whose father was a chemist, whose grandfather was a
[strike]in his ?own[/strike]
[strike]boat[/strike] [strike]fisherman, was denouncing with how if they asked him,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]had C English literature[/strike]
was denouncing them.
Being [strike]a[/strike] the son of a working man [strike]he was of course[/strike] [strike]he was[/strike]
he [strike]approached literature from a different point of view.[/strike]
he said
Literature is not a mere pastime for idle hours.
So many
people at the table had enjoyed some books occasionally that
they felt  uncomfortable.
If only Prue would be decently kind
to him, Mrs. Ramsay thought, he would not say these things.
[strike]But[/strike] for though William Bankes would never be [strike]rude,[/strike]
unkind, she could [strike]judge[/strike] what he was thinking - impertinent
puppy,
like that &

& all the rest of it. And he was not,

   William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.
Then
snatched his chance
Charles Tansley, like a dog [strike]let off the chain at last,[/strike]
[strike]denounced[/strike]
[strike]them[/strike] As the son of a chemist, the grandson of a fisherman, he
rushed in - all
because Prue would not be nice to him; &
denounced them;
when [strike]anybody[/strike] [strike]it was all[/strike] when he knew
nothing about it,
nothing whatever, Mrs. Ramsay thought,
[strike]like[/strike] [strike]All[/strike]
[strike]The world was so divided, she thought;[/strike] observing, rather
than listening, for it
was the way people said things, not the
actual things they said,
which convinced her. conveyed to her the
[strike]aptitude or[/strike] their aptitude
or disaptitude & you had only to
to [strike]see[/strike] tell

down the law
[strike]about the[/strike] [strike]to know how it was[/strike]
[strike]hopeless forever,[/strike]
[strike]how he knew nothing, nothing whatever, but[/strike]
[strike]then, ni[/strike]
that [strike]he did not know, had[/strike]
how he was among
those [strike]whose[/strike] the natural enemies
of all [strike]painting &[/strike] arts
[strike]writing,[/strike] for which she bore him no grudge.
No. For
then they were free to do other things; [strike]&, if it was unfortunate[/strike]
[strike]that it[/strike] young men of his type were [strike]necessary;[/strike] & [strike][?][/strike] if it was
unfortunate [strike]that[/strike] & [strike]did[/strike] hindered the progress of the world
that they had these limitations [strike]yet it was enviable, too, & left[/strike]
[strike]so that she had never known[/strike] it freed them; & lent him that
fierceness, that power, [strike]which[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] [strike]which issuing as it did[/strike]
which might issue in a love [strike]of ?his[/strike] mankind, qualified as that
seemed to be inevitably by his hatred of the arts - And
that
somebody, not Prue, would be kind to him, & then she felt,
[strike]again[/strike] he will not say [strike]all day long "my[/strike]
one moment
will be
"my dissertation;" the next, "my grandfather" - but [strike]would,[/strike]
[strike]well, he would[/strike] never be in the least like Mr. Carmichael -
For he was chanting somebodies poem, why she did not know
33
& in her [strike]clairvoyant[/strike] state she saw him denouncing the Waverly
novels because his feelings were snubbed, & thus he must protest,
how
he
was the
son of a workingman, [[strike]?][/strike] &
& she could see how it was - he wanted to assert himself, & so
it would always be with him until he had [strike]was[/strike] [strike]his[/strike] got his
professorship, or married his wife, [strike]& then he [strike]would be[/strike][/strike]
[strike]very valuable in some way. she had free to do what[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]but at present he could only say at one moment[/strike]
[strike]"my dissertation"[/strike]
[strike]but[/strike] & it was [strike]sheer non[/strike] [strike]moonshine all this about[/strike]
when he was
thinking of himself
nonsense for him to [strike]pretend that he[/strike] to talk about books;
as she could tell by the sound of his voice, & his emphasis, & his
uneasiness. [strike]But he[/strike] [strike]But inevitably the[/strike] [strike]But[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] In her
clearsightedness which seemed [strike]to pierce the[/strike] [strike]without effort[/strike] or
[strike]bitterness to unveil one after another,[/strike] to go round the table
unveiling each of them without effort, [strike]in a tranquil[/strike] like a
light stealing under the water so that its ripples, & the reeds in it,
& the
impression
he was
making,
& the minnows balancing themselves & the sudden silent
trout are all held up in their reality to the [strike]view[/strike] eye to [strike]feast on[/strike]
look upon: [strike]then glancing[/strike] she saw & heard them
[strike]& liked her husband for his annoyance: about the Waverly novels; yet[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]for he was being saddened suddenly & sincerely by this little[/strike]
[strike]man's dislike of the Waverly novels - which he knew by heart;[/strike]
[strike][strike]then she like[/strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]for what & then there was Mr. Bankes[/strike]
[strike]liked Jane Austen, &[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]& their but whatever they said[/strike]
[strike](for instance[/strike] Mr.
had this quality [strike]that it[/strike] as if [strike]when she saw[/strike]
& ?friends
what they said was [strike]only[/strike] like the movement of the trout, when
[strike]the same time the ripple moves, the light[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]changes quivers; & the[/strike]
[strike]all is suspended in the same[/strike]
one can see
the ripple & the
[strike]light, & the[/strike] whole life in the stream & the gravel, &
something
solemn & dark surrounding that one flash; so that [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]she now[/strike]
if
Mr. Bankes
said how much he preferred
35
Jane Austen to any other writer
so that it passed out of Mrs. Ramsay's mind [strike]that she ?did had any[/strike]
[strike]reason for[/strike] how, naturally, in daily life, she would be
casting a net over
all this, [strike]&[/strike] & forced by the
exigencies of behaviour to
separate & judge &
connect & applaud -
Now it was
37
[strike]But n[/strike]Now she dwelt on it; with her wings spread;
   It was [strike]really interesting.[/strike] How long do books last?
[strike]Then,[/strike] what qualities make them last? [strike]Then, Mr. Ramsay[/strike]
its being ?said
She minded the fact that Scott was out of date. Mr. Bankes
laughed & attached no importance to these changes in fashion. [strike]who[/strike]
Who could tell what was [strike]go[/strike] going to last? who minded?
Mr. Ramsay minded very much. He thought constantly of
his own fame;
Mr. Bankes scarcely ever thought of such
things at all.
Mr. Tansley was reading Tolstoy. [About
that he was quite enthusiastic.
Mrs. Ramsay thought
that he had given up thinking
about himself.
He
novel
thought War & Peace
the
greatest [strike]book[/strike] in the [strike]w[/strike] world. Still he
was thinking of himself a
little. He was never as
impersonal as Mr. Bankes.
What is taste? asked
Mr. Bankes.
Nothing made him budge from his own
view -
he did not mind leaving books unread. He read Jane
Austen &
Scott over & over again. [strike]M[/strike] Paul Rayley
But
liked
Trollope
He could think of nothing clever to say.
[strike]however[/strike]
[strike]so he[/strike] Minta said [strike]her grea[/strike] she did not
really
believe that anybody
liked [strike]reading[/strike] Shakespeare.
[strike]At this[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay
[strike]liked this very much indeed.[/strike]
[strike]And[/strike] ?[strike]he[/strike] agreed that
very few people liked it as
much as they said they did.
[strike]Andrew thought that[/strike]
[strike]this was going too far.[/strike]
[strike]But some of it is[/strike]
[strike]People might not see that his father was ironical.[/strike]
but he
added
There is considerable merit in some of it, however,
he said.
Minta supposed he was was making
fun of her.
But she did not mind in the least.
He was so vain, so extraordinarily vain, that
one need never be frightened of him - perhaps not so
much frightened of him as of Mrs. Ramsay, who was not
39
not vain, so that you could scarcely take her off her guard.
Mrs. Ramsay thought [strike]almost[/strike] almost the same thing of Paul
Rayley - how much nicer, she found stupidity than cleverness.
& perhaps more
inscrutable
For the stupid have no ambition to thrust themselves forwards,
& thus instead of always thinking am I being clever, am I
being admired they think whether one is hot or cold, whether
one [strike]mu[/strike] feels the draught, or would like [strike]another[/strike] a pear;
She might sit there
forever, & Charles Tansley would never
remember to offer her a pear.
But then Paul
Rayley
[strike]And[/strike] would; & so, [strike]again[/strike] [strike]spr[/strike]
fluttering her
wings over the table & all these odds & ends of speech,
which were like the [strike]little[/strike] darts & dashes of trout, she
felt no
[strike]grudge against Charles Tansley,[/strike] [strike]any more than[/strike]
[strike]against that fish, for[/strike] [strike]how there is no[/strike] [strike]The reeds[/strike] saw
at the same time the reeds in the pool, & the
walls of brown water [strike]& the night,[/strike] [strike]when[/strike]
Nancy
surrounding them; [strike]when,[/strike] [strike]having looked at the[/strike]
deciding that after all she did not want a pear,
she
suddenly saw Rose's creation, rising up like a
crown or bouquet of flowers on the top of the water;
with its beautiful curves, & its interstices, its hollows &
huge bulges; [strike]something[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]extraordinarily[/strike]
& her
eyes
[strike]beautiful[/strike] [strike]it was[/strike] [strike]she pl[/strike] she too, like Mr.
Carmichael, went plundering the fruit, [strike]n[/strike]
[strike]trying[/strike] first looking at the banana, then at the pears,
& putting one colour against another, one curve, one
hollow, without knowing why she did it, but
[strike]gett[/strike] each time she [strike]saw[/strike] did it she [strike]was[/strike]
became gradually more satisfied, & [strike]more[/strike] [strike]until rising[/strike] she
[strike]saw to[/strike] & she [strike]called[/strike] looked at Rose & Timothy &
Prue & Andrew all sitting side by side, & thought
41
Mrs. Ramsay knew all that, & hoped that the talk would soon leave
But then
this dangerous subject of [strike]book[/strike] the fame of books.
Minta said
she did not believe that anyone really enjoyed reading
Shakespeare. &
   But he added, there is considerable merit in some of the plays.
saw
& Mrs. Ramsay [strike]wondered whether[/strike] [strike]?th[/strike] [strike]seeing[/strike] that Minta
liked being laughed
at & was not frightened; [strike]that[/strike] she
realised his extreme vanity, & would take care of him,
so that she attended now to [strike]Paul Rayley[/strike] who [strike]wished to[/strike]
anxiety about his
own books & his
own fame,
[strike]to show that he had read books[/strike] to what Paul Rayley was
trying to say: how he thought Trollope was better in his way
than Dickens. A very stupid remark. Mrs. Ramsay
knew that, but then how much nicer stupidity is, she
thought [strike]when[/strike] than cleverness, for when Charles Tansley
said that War & Peace knocked out all the Waverly novels &
all Jane Austen, what he meant was Tolstoy would have
approved [strike]as[/strike] of me, but not of you (that is, not of
people who have servants & table napkins) - & [strike]that was[/strike]
[strike]really stupider,[/strike] [strike]more stupid;[/strike] he was thinking of himself,
but Paul, like all stupid people, never thought am I
being clever, am I being admired, never thought about
himself at all, but whether she was hot or cold,
whether she felt the draught, whether she wanted a
pear.
[strike]And though she[/strike] She did not want a pear; [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]wanted him to go on, ?being[/strike] [strike]wanted nothing;[/strike] [strike]Her[/strike]
[strike]eyes rested on the dish of fruit[/strike] She did not want
anybody to take any fruit. Her eyes rested on the
dish & went in & out of the [strike]round[/strike] apples & the
thick [strike]bananas into[/strike] the interstices & hollows, among
the grapes & bananas, putting a yellow against a
purple, & then a curved [strike]ag[/strike] shape against a round shape,
&
43
without knowing why she did it, or why [strike]she[/strike] [strike]beca[/strike] as she did it she
became happier, & then she thought, looking at Rose, who
[strike]set[/strike] sat between Timothy & Prue, how [strike]t[/strike] odd[strike], she[/strike]
that one's child should do that!
her children
to see them sitting there,
   How odd that they should sit there in a row, Timothy
Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke
of their own going on, she [strike]kn[/strike] knew, from the twitching of
their lips.
[strike]What it could be, she[/strike] It was something [strike][?][/strike]
quite apart from [strike]what[/strike] everything else,
something
that would not end when
they were hoarding up: something
that would
that would [strike]serve[/strike] to carry the world
on when her own
all that
ripple was spent.
[strike]Hoarded behind[/strike] There [strike]was[/strike] hoarded
the door
was shut
upon their
own room -
she wondered
what.
As if the joke
wd explode
when they were
all dead in the
future -
behind those rather set, rather solemn faces; for they did
not yet talk easily, [strike]though Prue[/strike] [strike]But[/strike] Prue certainly was
tonight

lovely, lovelier than she had ever looked, as if the
glow of Minta opposite, the [strike]sense of[/strike] happiness, the
excitement of the evening, were reflected in her; [strike]but[/strike] it was
the [strike][?][/strike] rising of that marvellous
sun, [strike]?man[/strike] the love of
men & women, which, [strike]as it[/strike]
was stealing over the
rim of the tablecloth, & [strike]wit[/strike] entirely
without her
[strike]restin[/strike] in her eyes & making
knowing it, was [strike]giving her that sky that[/strike]
making her
curiously
glance at Minta now & then, shyly,
[strike]happily[/strike], so that
Mrs. Ramsay, hovering over one &
then over another
vowed to ?herself But
as they said this & that,
[strike]you shall ?have,[/strike] [strike]all that,[/strike]
[strike]much[/strike] more [strike]than all that[/strike] [strike](for she was her own[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]daughter)[/strike]
[strike]one of these days.[/strike]
But you will be
far happier one of these days, because you are
my daughter, she meant, & therefore it was certain
that she would be happier, as they were all, to Mrs.
45
&
protected in some odd way, [strike]made[/strike]
raised above the lot of
ordinary people - a fact which was due to her husband, not herself,
that [strike]great man,[/strike] [strike]but he[/strike] & [strike]rising[/strike] she [strike]said rose &[/strike]
& hesitating for a moment she looked to see if they were ready
to leave the dinner table: but he was having some joke with
Minta; [strike]a bet about some ?game, thing;[/strike] about a bet,
how proper
[?] in
she waited;
[strike]of course[/strike] Paul Rayley was thinking how
marvellous Minta was
&
William Bankes [strike]had really[/strike] wa
enjoyed himself she knew; & Charles Tansley - she
&
liked him better for being so annoyed.
Lily seemed to
how aloof she
was! how
independent
of them all!
[strike]have some private joke of her own - she lik that was[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]Lily's point; &[/strike]
[strike]she always had some little affair of her own[/strike]
moment
she felt
[strike]on hand -[/strike]
[strike]She waited.[/strike]
This partook of eternity; was
[strike]imm[/strike] immune from change!
[strike]A[/strike] This glowed in the face of
chaos; [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]She looked at the window. But the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]but it was now so dark that only the candles were[/strike]
[strike]to be seen in it;[/strike]
[strike]dark now, with candles wavering in it.[/strike]
[strike]They were like[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]Here were the walls of the stream[/strike]
which surrounded
[strike]them, & then[/strike] as [strike]they were by the walls[/strike]
& it seemed to her as if she [strike]were still floating[/strike]
could go in & out here, [strike]among the dishes[/strike] & the glasses,
glowed
even as the window with its little candlelights (for
as
the pane was now dark [strike]with[/strike] night[strike])[/strike] & the flames
burnt brighter) [strike]glowed[/strike] &
also it was like a
a poem a
great cathedral
with the sudden bursts of laughter, &
then one voice [strike]spea[/strike]
(Minta's) speaking alone; &
[strike]it[/strike] like some service
in a Roman Catholic Church;
which always [strike]seemed to[/strike] her irreverent & therefore
