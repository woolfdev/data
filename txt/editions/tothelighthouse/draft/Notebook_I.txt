The plan of this book is roughly that it shall consist of three parts:
one, Mrs. Ramsay (?) sitting at the window: while Mr. R walks up &
down in the dusk: the idea being that there shall be curves of
conversation or reflection or description or in fact anything, modulated
by his appearance & disappearance at the window: gradually it
shall grow later; the child shall
go to bed;
the engaged couple shall
appear: But this is all to be
filled up as richly and variously as
possible. My aim being
shall be less emphatic & intense
than that in Mrs. D: an everyday
sentence for carrying on the narrative easily.
The theme of the
1st
part shall [u]really[/u] contribute
to Mrs. R's 
character; at least
Mrs. R's character shall be
displayed, but finally [strike]with[/strike] in
conjunction with his, so
that one gets an impression
of their
relationship
To precipitate feeling, there should be a sense of waiting, of expectation:
the
child
waiting to go to the Lighthouse: the woman awaiting the 
the return of the
couple.
The passing of time. I am not sure how this is to be given: an
interesting experiment, [strike]showi[/strike] giving the sense of 10 years passing.
This is the voyage to the Lighthouse.
Several characters can be brought in: the young atheist, the old
gentleman: the lovers: Episodes can be written on woman's
beauty; on truth:
but
these should be greater & less knobbly
then
those in Mrs. D: making a more harmonious whole,
There need be no specification of date.
Whether this will be long or short, I do not know. The dominating
impression
is to be of Mrs. R's character.

[strike]This[/strike] the idea has grown in the interval
since I wrote the beginning. [strike]It[/strike] The presence of the 8
children, undifferentiated, should be important to
bring out the sense of life in opposition to fate -
i.e. waves, lighthouse. Then there is to be
some [strike]specif[/strike] movement as the evening passes: a
great dinner scene, all the family, & [u]after[/u] this I
think, Minta & Charles go out to become engaged
Also a scene in Mrs. Rs. bedroom, with children
choosing jewels while the birds rise & fall outside;
a scene of her descending the stairs, smelling burning fat;
but all is to draw in towards the end, & leave
the two alone: she expecting the return of the
young couple. That poetry should be used in
[?] quotations to give the character.
I observe today that I am writing exactly oppositely from my
other books: very loosely at first; not tight at first; & shall
have to tighten finally, instead of loosening
as always before. Also at

   "If it's a fine day tomorrow" said Mrs. Ramsay. "But you'll
have to be up with the lark," she added.
[strike]her[/strike] these
To her son [strike]these[/strike] words conveyed an extraordinary impression of
joy. It seemed [strike]indeed[/strike] as if it were now settled, & the expedition
to [strike]which he[/strike] [strike]with all its[/strike] certain to take place, & [strike]the[/strike]
the wonders to which he had looked forward [strike]the[/strike] [strike]br[/strike] [strike]brought[/strike] within touch
with
[strike]so near only a night & a sail[/strike] only a dazzling, uneasy
pains
disquietude, [strike]a glittering[/strike] a nights, & then a day's sail, between.
Since he belonged [strike]to the[/strike] even at the age of six to that great
clan which cannot keep its emotions within separate
compartments, but must let future prospects, & their
joy or sorrow, colour [strike]th[/strike] what is [strike]bec[/strike] [strike]go[/strike] actually on hand,

people, even in earliest childhood, [strike]the[/strike] a joy or a sorrow

power to crystallise or transfix any moment, upon which its
gloom or radiance alights James Ramsay, sitting on the
floor, cutting out pictures from the Catalogue of the Army &
enbalmed
Navy Stores, [strike]endowed[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] [strike]phot[/strike] [strike]refrigerat[/strike] the picture of a
refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly [strike]tenderness.[/strike]

[strike]sounds[/strike], [strike]pop[/strike] the sound of the poplar trees, leaves whitening

in his mind; [strike]&[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] had already his private code
[strike]of[/strike] his [strike]language which is[/strike] own language, & though
[strike]it would have been[/strike] to look at, [strike]in his[/strike] he appeared
the [strike]im[/strike] picture of stark & uncompromising severity.
so that his mother imagined him playing a man's part in
11
[strike]some crisis of public affairs, he was at the moment expanding &[/strike]
[strike]contracting, contracting & expanding like the mainspring of a watch[/strike]
[strike]with joy.[/strike]
   "But" said Mr. Ramsay, stopping in front of the window,
it won't be fine."
   If there had been a knife handy, or any sharp implement
which could have gashed his father's breast & [strike]l[/strike][strike]et[/strike] killed him where he
there and then
stood, James would have seized it. [strike]He hated him, loathed him[/strike]
[strike]from the depths of his heart.[/strike] Mr. Ramsay excited extremes of
such
emotion, [strike]he spoke the truth;[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] for he said what was disagreeable; he 
but then
[strike]said what was true. His[/strike] but it was true [strike]what he said[/strike]. He was
incapable of [strike]altering[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] tampering with any fact, of altering
any [strike]thing which[/strike] truth, to suit the pleasure or convenience of
any mortal being, least of all his own children, of the male sex in particular,
who should be [strike]impervious to such[/strike] from childhood made aware
[strike]of the[/strike] that life is hard, [strike]life is[/strike] truth [strike]is[/strike] uncompromising, & the
passage to that fabled land, where according to Mr. Ramsay
our brightest hopes are extinguished, & our little barks
founder in the darkness, is one that needs, above all, [strike]courage,[/strike] fortitude,
truth
[strike]&[/strike] [strike]strength[/strike], & the power to endure.
   "But it may be fine" said Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]turning some[/strike]
making some little adjustment of [?on] the stocking she was knitting

tomorrow, was to [strike]be put in the[/strike][strike] b[/strike] given to the men.

How would you like to see
the same dreary waves breaking all day long?
& it would be much
worse in winter, when [strike]there were[/strike] storms, & sea birds
dashed against
the window, & the [strike]lit[/strike] little tower was covered with spray, & the
wind was so high that they couldn't even put their noses out of
doors without being blown [strike]away?[/strike] off into the sea?
Putting up his

   "[strike]Now[/strike] the wind [strike]has changed to the[/strike] is almost

The little atheist
was without
Mr. Ramsay's

Everybody in the house made

[strike]the[/strike] Mr. & Mrs.

but
Ramsay, for being [strike]so[/strike] disagreeable,
[strike]&[/strike] [strike]yet[/strike] by no means

Lucy mocked
at him; [strike]for[/strike]

&
Roger mocked at him;
Miss Doyle, Mr. Holcroft mocked at him; Patcham &
Mildred, & Silas, [strike]all[/strike] mocked at him; even old Badger without a

   But this was [strike]being[/strike] [strike]simply rude, &[/strike] simple silliness, said Mrs.
Ramsay.
   Sara Ramsay could be far too severe.

For, apart from the fact that they [strike]were in the[/strike] were not in the Hebrides,
but in the Isles of Skye, apart from the exaggeration ^ Mrs. Ramsay much
[strike]particularly[/strike] disliked incivility to her guests [strike]on[/strike]
particularly if they were rather humble rather [strike]unattractive[/strike] young

men, on the part of her daughter. All young men, [strike]according to[/strike]
had claims upon her. It might be said indeed that she had taken
the whole of the opposite sex under her protection; [strike]& that[/strike] for reasons
which she was incapable of explaining or realising, for reasons which
had [strike]no[/strike] their birth not in her own lifetime, but in her mothers, &
even her grandmothers, [strike]so that for reasons which were[/strike]
[strike]apart from[/strike] [strike]Apart from these reasons, they[/strike] for their

[strike]could deny them those achievements; & the if in[/strike] [strike]But[/strike]
all [strike]this gave them a claim upon her[/strike] for an attitude

towards herself which surely [strike]any[/strike] [strike]needed no[/strike] anyone could [strike]understand[/strike]

woe betide the girl who did not feel it, & respect it - So

never think worth considering any [strike]timid, half hearted way of life,[/strike] or
or
evasion, [strike]any[/strike] failure[strike], or[/strike] to fulfil duties; - & here the severity of her face,
increased; [strike]to such a degree that[/strike] She was then formidable to
behold; & it was only in silence that her daughters - Rose, Lucy, Prue -
could sport with those infidel ideas [strike]of[/strike] which certainly they had
brewed for themselves, of a life far lonelier than hers, & less
strict, of a life, Prue thought, on an island among sea birds, or
Rose thought, not on an island, but in Paris with painters; &
with
Lucy being the youngest, [strike]& scarcely[/strike] print petticoats scarcely
below her knee, thought just a life - but in all their
a life
new
minds was the same constant questioning of [strike]all this[/strike] beautiful,
manly-womanly relationship, its deference & chivalry,
humility charity, Bank of England & Empire of India elements,
[strike]which were[/strike] its flowing skirts & white hands [strike][?][/strike] though to them all
there was something even in this of the essence of beauty; something
which called out the masculine element in all their girlish
hearts & made them, as they sat beneath their mothers
eyes, worship her strange severity, her [strike]sim[/strike] exaggerated
nobility, her extreme & lovely courtesy, [strike]as of a[/strike] a Queen's,
like
[strike]to the[/strike] [strike]who holds out her foot to be[/strike] washes a beggar's foot,
to the [strike]atheist Tansley. Moreover, there was[/strike]
this wretched little man who had chased them, speaking
accurately to the Isles of Skye.
For there could be no two opinions: he was surely
19
   For there could be no two opinions about Charles Tansley: he was a
miserable specimen. When he took his coat off to play cricket he
was all humps & hollows;
[strike]but what he liked best was[/strike] [strike]& he joked so[/strike]
Then one could hear
him
he walked
ever
walking up &
joked
sarcastically
[strike]stiffly, &[/strike] he poked & shuffled;
[strike]what he liked best[/strike] was
forever
forever
down with Mr. Ramsay, &
saying who had won this & that,
who was
[strike]the[/strike] a 'first rate man'
[strike]at this or that,[/strike]
who was 'brilliant but
fundamentally unsound' who [strike],[/strike] was the ablest [strike]the[/strike] fellow in
Balliol, who had buried his light temporarily, at Bristol or
Bedford, but was bound to be heard of later when [strike]some[/strike]
his Prolegomena, of which Mr. Tansley had read the first
pages
[strike]chapters[/strike] in
proof, [strike]saw the light[/strike] were[strike] finally delivered[/strike] - to
branch of
interest
not
day. [strike]His most serious shortcoming, however,[/strike] It might be true
that the great universities of England & Scotland were [strike]institutions[/strike]
lamps [strike]of[/strike] which in all ages had attracted to themselves the
finest spirits, plants of light, [strike]which[/strike] like the wax white
bell shaped flowers in the [strike]gard[/strike] garden
of
clarity &
luminous, stately
dignity
when all
was thorn & thistle round them.
Nobody had a word to say
or universities in the abstract
against learning as such. Mr. Ramsay himself always
impressed, however he might annoy,
by a [strike]purity,[/strike]
&
[strike]an[/strike] integrity
which was that of ivory or bone from which all superfluity [strike]or[/strike]
the daily dropping fine
had been eaten away by [strike]the[/strike] some caustic; [strike]dropped day by day,[/strike]
no
But Charles Tansley, [strike]was not that;[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley,[/strike] [strike]having[/strike]
[strike]learnt all the parrot phrases of learning, its repeated[/strike]
simply what he had picked up;                                     He might
could
repeat; [strike]word for word, all the[/strike] [strike]sad disillu[/strike] [strike]authorative[/strike]
[strike]denunciations[/strike] [strike]m[/strike] [strike]of[/strike] he could deny; he could correct; he
could purse his lips up when Mrs. Ramsay who was herself given to
picturesque exaggerations, spoke of waves "mountains high"
& of everyone "drenched to the skin, & say certainly it had been
a little rough, & his overcoat was wet but not right through;
but when it came to adding something, to giving himself away, so to
speak, to being not merely a repetition - but there, whoever it

was of Mrs. Ramsay's seven children that was trying to explain what was
lacking in Charles Tansley, petered out dismally & fell an easy
now
prey to whoever wanted to talk about something else.
She fell an easy prey, for how could one [strike]give[/strike] [strike]find[/strike] reasonably explain
that when she said she detested him, something [strike]almost[/strike] so remote as to
at
be almost ungetable, so irrational as to be ridiculous could one
get at it, came to her mind, or rather presented itself before her in a
series of [strike]litt actions[/strike] - things he did - [strike]judgments[/strike], or judgments upon
wh
he pressed
(his shufflings his
grunts his
subjects of which she knew nothing, like architecture or cookery, which
so offended her that had she been either cook or architect [strike]had[/strike]
?
she practised any art which fell beneath his notice, there
would have been[strike] such deathly chilliness such an antipathy would[/strike]
the
[strike]have risen between them,[/strike] [strike]nothing[/strike] [strike]for[/strike] it but fight. [strike]Such[/strike]
It was strange
[strike]souls were damned;[/strike] [strike]cut[/strike] off, in this indescribable way by
He was cut

something not much more emphatic than a cough, or a
mannerism, from all share in [strike]natural[/strike] human life,
condemned for ever to remain, like these [strike]ab[/strike] [strike]brilli[/strike] able Jones',
brilliant but [strike]fundamentally unsound[/strike] Smiths, college dons,
[strike]teachers, vociferators, men who could never be[/strike] admitted to
or
[strike]little men,[/strike] little miseries; & yet it was perfectly true, what William
said, that he got on very well with Mr. Ramsay [strike]It[/strike] [strike]Nobody said he[/strike]
[strike]was stupid; it[/strike] He was no fool. [strike]&[/strike] But why Mrs.
Ramsay [strike]so w[/strike] was so annoyed if they laughed at him,
Mr. Ramsay
just because [strike]he[/strike] liked talking to him? But what reason was that?
23
   Then he could [strike]li[/strike] lift his eyebrows & sneer; he could "suspect a
& all the rest of it
little sentimental humbug" [strike]with the best[/strike] of them. When Mrs.
Ramsay, herself inclined to exaggeration, spoke of waves "mountains
high" of everyone "drenched to the skin", he would say
"certainly it had been a little rough", & his overcoat was "damp, but
not wet through". - He would change his socks - that was all.
But when it came to explaining how it was not this that one
objected to [strike]in[/strike] [strike]the [?] little atheist,[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] one did not mind
one was

how

[strike]sentiments which[/strike] but objected to [strike]his ugliness,[/strike] something
all over
diffused [strike]& universal[/strike] in him - his essence, in short - then it
became more difficult, &, short of allowing the conversation to be
changed, it was necessary to lodge a more definite complaint -
for example
was [strike]what one called[/strike]
simply
was
to the effect [strike]for example[/strike] that he [strike]protested[/strike] was a prig.
But a prig? - [strike]what is[/strike] that? [strike]Give him[/strike] Some one who had no
of his own
and had
anyhow
[strike]natural[/strike] [strike]easy[/strike] feelings, [strike]but had to fake[/strike] them. Observe him when
they talked about anything interesting - not facts, or history, of
course, for there he was in his element. But [strike]suppose[/strike]
pictures or poetry; or whether it was not [strike]so[/strike] the loveliest
in the world
seen
evening there had ever been? Then, [strike]how[/strike] no crab on dry
arid

land showed more angular & [strike]uneasy[/strike] & until he had thought of
[strike]which did not[/strike] something to say which had no bearing upon
the subject, but if you examined into it, merely asserted his own
virtue
[strike]virtue,[/strike] [strike]for he[/strike] [strike]Claim[/strike] [strike]right to his[/strike] [strike]his right to[/strike] be [strike]a plain man,[/strike]
[strike]some one who did not like mere beau[/strike] (that he [strike]was[/strike] for the [strike]same[/strike]

rather liked books to have a meaning, pictures to be like something;
& was very [strike]plain and[/strike] that you could not expect ?[strike]the[/strike] working

people to enjoy beauty until they were certain of a nights

he was [strike]very like a little crab, blind, discomfited.[/strike]
Until he had given the conversation a little flick, & made it

[strike]somehow[/strike] bear witness to the struggles which he had been through himself, &
the sense he had of [strike]suffering,[/strike] disorder, & social injustice, which
no fine evenings or fine[strike] ph[/strike] phrases could remedy, he was, like a
crab, [strike]puzzled, irritated, out of[/strike] set on a table, turning this way & that,

have liked him better if he had not told her this & been [strike]so[/strike]
conscious of it, & dwelt upon his poverty - [strike]but[/strike] when Mrs.

& all round it, fading & falling, low, desolate [strike]grey like[/strike] with sand dunes &
green with [strike]gr[/strike] wild flowing grasses which even across the water seemed
to be running away into silence, into wildness, into some eternal
[strike]eternal[/strike]
communion of their own, [strike]with[/strike]
[strike]silent[/strike] unimparted, with the
sky & the sea.
It was this view that her husband loved;

His picture, like almost all [strike]that[/strike] painted [strike]there[/strike] in
the island; [strike]was a little spectral.[/strike] Since the visit of Mr. Pauncefort
three years ago, was a [strike]little[/strike] green & grey with a lemon coloured boat & a
[strike]distant[/strike]
pink lady; but Mrs. Ramsay [strike]who[/strike] was at a remove from pictures,
who
she criticised art almost entirely [strike]from the point of v[/strike]
as she supposed her grandmother's friends would have criticised it, &
the tip
imbuing his
brush [strike]with[/strike] in

pink or grey
now
had imposed a
method, or 
point of view,
could tell [strike]yo[/strike] many a tale of the difficulty these great men
had had in keeping their colours damp.
[strike]First, she told Mr. Tansley, there was the business of grinding the[/strike]
[strike]paints: next they had to be soaked in salad oil.[/strike]
For
among her grandmothers friends, there were many who
mixed their own colours,
[strike]It was a fact that seemed,[/strike] to
first ground them, then soaked them in salad oil; & it was this
attitude which had, was [strike]not[/strike] very critical of this school, &
[strike]Mr.[/strike] Tansley was impressed by the extreme ?derision/?decision with which she
pronounced against Mr. ?Beasley's lighthouse, directly they were out
of hearing.
45
It was often a matter of considerable difficulty. [strike]As[/strike] it had been her
privilege to help sometimes in these studios.] Thus she unveiled slightly the
treasure chamber of her past, which Mr. Tansley felt certain was such a past as
he most coveted full of interesting [strike]people[/strike] [strike]cultivated[/strike] people; with an
& the highest standard
With her sanction
infallible tastes in art & literature.
[strike]With Mrs. Ramsay's sanction,[/strike] he too
dismissed the Paunceforte school of [strike]mod[/strike] painting, [strike]with its[/strike] &

[strike]satirised[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] dismissed with a smile, these pictures of grey
sands & [strike]green wa[/strike] pink ladies which had [strike]none of the qualities[/strike]
obvious defects, since the painters [strike]scamped their work;[/strike] & did not
as Mrs. Ramsay remembered her grandmother's friends doing,
grind their colours for themselves, & keep them moist.
But her

not wish to make a fool of himself, & gush over a woman's
beauty, [strike]moreover[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay was a woman fifty into the
bargain, & had eight children. Still it did come over
how extraordinary it was ?as ?to
him at the moment; & take his breath away. And he noticed how,
as they walked down the street, he carrying her basket, & she
again holding the black parasol erect, people [strike]just[/strike] looked
out as she passed, looked at her as if they were startled & then
looked down, poor men, who were hawking fish, or leaning against
the wall in the sunshine, looked at her, with the same odd
stare; [strike]which[/strike] of which Mrs. Ramsay seemed perfectly unconscious.

she had let him think would be gratified tomorrow. But now - it

long handles would [strike]want[/strike] extraordinary [strike]skl[/strike] skill.
All
these young men parodied her husband, she reflected. If [u]he[/u] said it was

[strike]That loveliness[/strike] So Lily Briscoe & William Bankes
standing there felt in spite of their differences, a common
hilarity, [strike]for a[/strike] [strike]expressed[/strike] excited by the swift cutting
skating movement of a [strike]b[/strike] [strike]b[/strike] sailing boat which,
having sliced a curve in the bay, stopped
shivered, lets its sails fall; & then, [strike]Mr. Bankes,[/strike]
with a natural instinct, [strike]wh[/strike] [strike]which led them to[/strike]
after this swift movement, both of them looked at the
dunes, far away, & instead of merriment felt come over
them some [strike]thing like[/strike] sadness. Yet why? [strike]Was[/strike] It was
[strike]grey green[/strike] partly the grey green colour, & then the
distance; & the everlasting look of distant views
which seem to outlast by a million years the gazer;
to be already communing with a sky which
[strike]look[/strike] beholds an earth entirely at rest. Only,

William Bankes, who had been talking of Ramsay,
thought of him; thought of him, of course, long long ago,
desolate & austere on a mountain road somewhere in
Westmoreland, advancing by himself [strike]into the heart[/strike]
[strike]of th[/strike] that solitude which seemed to be his
?air
natural [strike]to him;[/strike] [strike]only[/strike] which was suddenly interrupted
hung around
with
(& this must actually have happened) by a
hen, advancing [strike][?][/strike] down a path, straddling her wings out in
protection of a whole covey of little chicks, upon
which Ramsay had pointed his stick & said
"Pretty - pretty" - an odd illumination into his heart,
Bankes thought it; & somehow it seemed to him as if
their friendship had ceased at a certain spot on
the mountain road. After that Ramsay had
married. After that, what with one thing or another,
the pulp had gone out of their intimacy. Whose
fault it was, he could not say, only, after a point,
some repetition had taken the place of freshness; &
though
newness
for showing him
tender & simple,
&
with that
love of [strike]humb[/strike] the
humble, the
genuine, wh.
was
95
[strike]they met still,[/strike] It was to repeat, that they met - William Bankes
however maintained in this instantaneous dumb colloquy
that his affection for Ramsay had no way diminished
& there, conserved like a [strike]fossil[/strike] the body of a young man
preserved in peat for a century, fresh with the red on
the lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness & reality,
[strike]kep[/strike] alive again when he looked across the bay at
the sand dunes.
97
[strike]So that[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] He was anxious [strike]to[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike]to convey[/strike] for the sake of this
friendship, & also, perhaps, in order to clear himself in his own
mind from the imputation of having [strike]himself[/strike] dried & shrunk,
for Ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas Bankes was
childless & a widower, - he was anxious that Lily Briscoe
[strike][?][/strike] should not [strike]fall into the error of[/strike] disparage Ramsay; [strike]or,[/strike]
yet
[strike]yet[/strike] should understand how things stood between them.
Begun long ago, their friendship had petered out on a
Westmoreland road, [strike]after which he[/strike] [strike]there had come to pass[/strike]
where the
hen
was
[strike]this curious fact[/strike] - [strike]& then, Ramsay having married,[/strike]
after which Ramsay having married, & their paths lying different
ways, there had been certainly, for no ones fault, [strike]&[/strike]
mainly
some tendency when they met to repeat. [strike]yes.[/strike]
as if it pained him,
   And so turning from the view
Mr. Bankes was [strike]so[/strike]
all alive to little things [strike]in this[/strike] which
would not have struck him,
had not [strike]that[/strike] those sandhills revealed to him the body of his

solitude to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings &
clacking domesticities; which while they had given him
something - William Bankes acknowledged that - [strike]had yet[/strike]

[strike]Silly brainless pretty girls[/strike] - [strike]a bad review[/strike] - to require
encouragement.
   "[strike]Well[/strike] [strike]b[/strike] But, said Lily Briscoe, think of his work."
As always on these occasions, that phantom kitchen table
swam before her, lodged in the fork of a pear tree
(for they had reached the orchard, the strawberry beds, the
vegetable garden.) And with a painful effort of
imagination she conscientiously focused her mind, not upon
the silver bossed bark of the tree, or its fish like leaves, but
upon a mind so differently constituted from her own
that it saw only a kitchen table which was not there.

& why should he not!
Indeed,
It would be delightful if James turned out to be a great artist. And so,
looking up, as [strike]Rhod[/strike] her husband again passed her, she
was relieved to find the ?ruin already veiled; domesticity
crooning
prevailing; custom [strike]casting its[/strike] humming its soothing rhythm; so
that when, drawing up by the window, he bent quizzically &
whimsically down to tickle James' [strike]ca[/strike] bare calf with a

Mrs. Ramsay rebuked her.

   "How [strike]did[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] know? The wind often changed."
she [strike]said[/strike] replied.
   [strike]The extraordinary irrationality of her remark enraged[/strike]
[strike]him.[/strike]
   [strike]When he told her what he happened to know,[/strike]
in his eyes
[strike]she should believe him.[/strike]
He stamped his foot on the

   The toe of his boot scraping on the rough step set her
teeth on edge; & He stamped ?his on the step

And what had she said? Simply that it

   He said he would step over & ask the coast guards if
she liked.
   [strike]And[/strike] There was nobody whom she reverenced as she did

Then
   She would take his word for it, she said. She
would not trouble to cut sandwiches or anything.
There was nobody who so made her feel [strike]so[/strike] safe. [strike]so[/strike].
They came to her, naturally, since she was a woman, all

feel secure &
protected,
this effort of his to arrive at a perfectly clear conception
of the problem which engaged the energies of his splendid [strike]brain[/strike]
intellect.
   The splendid intellect had no sort of difficulty, supposing
thought to be like the keyboard of a piano divided into so

He
reached Q. [strike](And it[/strike] [strike]was then that[/strike] stopping

to be turned from the room - "Mrs. Ramsay & I want to have a little

lay behind it; - as if he ?were [strike]not[/strike] not fit to be there - [strike]as if the[/strike]
[strike]were[/strike]
   And always now, he shrank from her. But
poor old man
what more could she have done? There was [strike]the[/strike] a sunny
room given up to him. Never did she show him the least
sign of not wanting him. [strike]Yet[/strike] She went out of her way, indeed,
to be kind, to be friendly - And after all - after all,
Mrs. Ramsay felt, she had not [strike]to[/strike] generally any difficulty in
?making her friends - Mr. Manning, George Wallace - feel
[strike]at their ease.[/strike] She [strike]had[/strike] [strike]did indeed know in her[/strike]

the

[strike]beauty,[/strike] [strike]that flame which was[/strike]
[strike]the[/strike] the torch of her beauty; & after all, after all -
veil it as she might & even shrink from the
monotony of bearing it imposed on her -
[strike]always to be admired was foolish to her thinking,[/strike]
Still, she had been admired. She had been loved. She
had entered rooms where mourners sat s[strike]olitary.[/strike] Tears,
had flown in her presence. Men, & women too, letting go
[strike]of all that little silly[/strike] the multiplicity of things - [strike]the[/strike]

?distorts - had allowed themselves with her that
[strike]extraordinary[/strike] relief of simplicity. It [strike]now[/strike] injured her
that Mr. Carmichael should shrink. It hurt her.
And yet, not cleanly, rightly. [strike]No.[/strike] [strike]She had[/strike]
That was what she minded - coming as
it did on top of her
discontent with her husband - [strike]she minded[/strike] the
sense she had now, when Mr. Carmichael
shuffled
past with the Spectator beneath his arm, in
his old flapping wide awake, that she was
[?the]
157
suspected, & that all this giving of hers was a form of
vanity. For her own self satisfaction was it, that she wished so
instinctively always to help & give - that they might say
of her, oh Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]there is no on like you.[/strike] Mrs.
Ramsay, Mrs. Ramsay - should call for her, need her, ask her
to

secretly desire all this, & therefore feel, when Mr.
Carmichael shrank away from her, not only the horror
of his [strike]wounds,[/strike] his wincing & flinching, & making off,
away, alone, to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly
[strike]endlessly[/strike], but also, humiliated?

      But the father of eight children has little choice.
With some such phrase as this Mr. Ramsay was apt to sum it all
up, to stop, to sigh, to [strike]fil[/strike] fill his pipe, [strike]to[/strike] seek out his wife, to
[strike]tick[/strike] tease his little boy James, to turn away from the
sight of human ignorance, & the dark dealing of human kind,
which, had he been in a position to contemplate it
fixedly might have absorbed him; & to find consolation in
something [strike]so[/strike] [strike]in itself[/strike] so slight mean, despicable
compared with the august theme of human [strike]ignorance[/strike]
fate
that he was [strike]not[/strike] disposed to slur over his relief, to
dissemble his joy, & [strike]thus[/strike] [strike]to[/strike] thus, disposed to slur it
over & blind himself & deprecate his natural appetite for
Thus
pleasure. Locke, Hume, & Bishop Berkely, & the fact
the figures of
that he had promised in very little over six weeks time -
[strike]in a curious[/strike]
the engagement was fixed for the middle of October - to talk some
nonsense to
[strike]lecture[/strike] the young men of Cardiff upon the English
philosophers, - [strike]al this had[/strike] [strike]these[/strike] this, & the pleasure he
took in it all - the pleasure he took in the compliment, in
the greeting, in the [strike]appla[/strike] phrases he made, in the applause
with which these phrases were greeted, in the
ardour of youth, in the beauty of his wife,
in the
atmosphere of recognition & admiration
which
surrounded him in Cardiff, Swansea,
Exeter, Southampton & Kidderminster when he lectured
upon the English philosophers, all this had to be
[strike]veiled in some[/strike] deprecated, veiled, made little of, - [strike]in[/strike]
 [strike]&[/strike] & if it [strike]had not been[/strike] [strike]because it is not[/strike]
[strike]it was not somehow[/strike] & concealed under the [strike]apparent[/strike]
appearance of dejection. "Talking nonsense to the young

to those [strike]who[/strike] like William Bankes, [strike]or[/strike] Lily Briscoe, who

In Mr.

Carlyle [strike]because of the[/strike] for this very reason. A surly old
shall ?no ?only
grumbler, how [strike]should[/strike] he preach to us was what Mr.
that the young people said nowadays.
Bankes understood them to say.
But Lily Briscoe,
thought that [strike]this being[/strike] human like the rest of us -
being [strike]even[/strike] specially human in a silly babyish way, like Mr.
[strike]Ramsay & Carlyle,[/strike] of wanting praise, & having no self control,
& thinking if one's little finger ached [strike]that the whole[/strike] world
was going to come to an end, this, though not good in itself,
had at any rate one advantage, looked at from an ordinary
[strike]point of view:[/strike] if Mr. Ramsay had been [strike]a [?Cart][/strike] great all through
[strike]consistent,[/strike] perhaps one would not have liked him.
Besides -
that one liked him better for it.
[strike]No he[/strike] Only There was one

one thing when you meant
another
a bit
Being a hypocrite? Mr. Bankes suggested
But who could call Mr. Ramsay a hypocrite? They
could not
looked at him; & no: you
[strike]cannot[/strike] call a man like that a
hypocrite; anything but
a hyprocrite: so shabby, so
distinguished, so
What indeed could they call
him to his face?
Lily Briscoe had to look
down at her brushes, which she was putting away
171
& to concentrate upon the idea of Mr. Ramsay in absence, before she
could put to herself, not to Mr. Bankes, her theory that
he asked too much of his wife (but that was largely her own fault) &
for her own part there was [strike]something[/strike] a side of things - ?typified
she looked at the jacmanna, the wall, the starlings - [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]that was[/strike] something spontaneous, [strike][?][/strike] ?very immediate [?]
which these teachers, of whom of course she was unworthy to
speak, these great men who saw, kitchen tables in pear trees &
lectured, worked & exhibited - of that there could be no doubt in
Mr. Ramsays case, the most perfect [?austerity/?authority] in private life -
there was a side of things which they neglected. Now
take Mr. Ramsay -
      Ah, said Mr. Bankes,
173
[strike]But this had to be to advanced with her eyes turned away. Directly[/strike]
[strike]she looked up &[/strike]

she
involved in
it all again,
Directly she looked up & saw them, became [strike]involved in[/strike]
[u]them[/u] [strike]a part of[/strike] their lives, received a station & had a part
allotted to her, & then of course
[strike]she could no more trace[/strike]
these diagrams [strike]than[/strike] [strike]because[/strike] of Mr. Ramsay & Mrs.
Ramsays [strike]became[/strike] [strike]his[/strike] characters became inundated with
feelings which she could not confine at all in the marks she
had made. Then, [strike]far from be[/strike] [strike]something else[/strike] she was [strike]at[/strike]
could not
retrace,
[strike]once[/strike] aware [strike]how[/strike] of a million million things; which
they both
that man walking, that woman sitting were; [strike]how[/strike] of
they were house & trees & [strike]t[/strike] sky & garden; yes, &
& had her,
in part allotted
to her, &
part of herself too;
[strike]It was odd indeed that[/strike]
[strike]how one felt[/strike] that was the delight of staying with them -
[strike]that they did[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] that every now & then - [strike]when one[/strike]
one was
snapped up
sat down [strike]to dinner, fifteen[/strike] [strike]life[/strike] life broke like a wave on a
rock. [strike]Then, it was not[/strike] & one could not [strike]be sure[/strike]
[strike]whether one was[/strike] [strike]what one was, what any one was[/strike] -

Grasped them up
[strike]took[/strike] one up, [strike]?bent one out,[/strike] & flung one [strike]in[/strike] down,
splash, in one wave.
It was like a wave of the sea
It was
   [strike]In all this,[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]was the prime force[/strike]
that was the prime force in all this; no doubt.

   Now Mrs. Ramsay - Lily Briscoe was
within
175 
[strike]inclined to[/strike] rather [strike]thought she had[/strike] wished [strike]to tell Mr. Bankes[/strike]
rather thought [strike]she[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] had, looking up & looking down,
[strike]arrived[/strike] she had something to say about her; but before she had
said it - [strike]& it was nothing very something[/strike] Mr. Bankes had
[strike]all[/strike] put it out of her head entirely by his rapture. For
such it was, considering his age was turned sixty & he
had both the asperity & the cleanliness of a scientist
spiritually again
wore, [strike]almost[/strike] spiritually, a white coat & smelt of
disinfectants: [strike]For this elderly &[/strike]
For him to gaze at
a rapture
Mrs. Ramsay like that was equivalent,
Lily Briscoe felt, to
the loves of dozens of young men; [strike]but it was dis[/strike] it was
love distilled & filtered; it was love that had never
but
attempted to clutch its object, [strike]but had[/strike] &,
like the love
[strike]of the[/strike] which mathematicians bear their [strike]f[/strike] symbols, &
was meant
to be spread over the
world & made part
of the universal
inheritance
[strike]arti[/strike] writers [strike]bear[/strike] their visions, [strike]it[/strike] it was [strike]intense &[/strike]
both intense & [strike]quite[/strike] impersonal: The world should have
shared it, had it been in his power, [strike]he[/strike] [strike]but it was not[/strike] in
Mr. Bankes power to say why that woman so pleased him.
Why the sight of her, reading fairy stories to her child in
the window, had upon him precisely the same effect as [strike]a[/strike] the
beautiful [strike]solution of[/strike] [strike]piece of work[/strike] [strike]demonstration in[/strike]
solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in
contemplation of it, & felt (as if he had proved something about
that
the digestive system of plants) [strike]how[/strike] the reign of chaos [strike]had[/strike] was
[strike]been[/strike] subdued.
   Such a rapture - for by what word was one to call it? -
made Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to
say. It was nothing of importance; something about
Mrs. Ramsay.
[strike]Yet,[/strike] It paled beside this 'rapture'
(an intense, impersonal, silent stare) of Mr. Bankes', for
which she worshipped him; for she felt that
177
nothing so solaced her [strike]of the[/strike] in the conflict of life, so eased her of the sense
of futility, & miraculously raised all the trivial worry from
her shoulders, as this solemn power. & one no more disturbed it, or
interrupted it then, broke the sunlight lying straight upon
the [strike]matting:[/strike] floor
   That people should love [strike]other people[/strike] their kind, in this way,
was
that Mr. Bankes should feel this for Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]seemed to[/strike] her
so satisfactory, to beautiful, satisfactory,
helpful, [[strike]?][/strike] exalting
[strike]Under the[/strike] She wiped first one brush, then another, [strike]upon[/strike]
with a piece of old rag. [strike]Some[/strike] [strike]As a woman, too[/strike] she
took shelter beneath [strike]the[/strike] a reverence which covered all
herself too
women. [strike]She[/strike] felt praised.
But, when she considered the
[strike]beginning of[/strike] her picture - & she could not help taking a
look at it, after her [strike]afternoon's work,[/strike] walk round the
garden, her picture of the hedge, the wall, & the jachmanna,
[strike]the[/strike] she [strike]could have wept.[/strike] [strike]was discomforted.[/strike] It was so bad.
Mr. Paunceforte would have seen it [strike]all[/strike] half transparent, in
greys & silver, with spots of green & rose. She saw it
[strike]directly[/strike]
[strike]entirely differently;[/strike] [strike]& her picture was already hal[/strike]
heavy & clumsy, - [strike]Still if[/strike] [strike]She saw it[/strike] glaring, staring
in greens & blues. [strike]And[/strike] It would never be hung anywhere;
& it was a waste of time; & Mrs. Tansley
[strike]was always[/strike] said
possibly
Now
She recollected
[strike]saying[/strike] that no woman could paint;
to go on
painting:
[strike]then[/strike] what she had been going to say about Mrs. Ramsay,
when Mr. Bankes [strike]inter[/strike] put it out of her mind, looking as he did;
that
she had been going [strike]to say[/strike] [strike]how[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay always

[strike]seemed to her a[/strike] led the conversation somehow towards [strike]the[/strike]
her funniness. ?That [strike]there was the solemn side, everybody[/strike]
to the funniness of
knew; but did
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]& her being[/strike] as she was
not sheltered by this sort of worship; (for [strike]two women[/strike]
[strike]were[/strike] it was impossible for two women to
for no [strike]two[/strike] women could not [strike]shelter each other[/strike]
worship each other [strike]but as[/strike] could [strike]not[/strike] only seek shelter
it
was
179
under the shade which men like Mr. Bankes extended over them; she
could not look at Mrs. Ramsay quite in that light, though she did
think her [strike]und[/strike] undoubtedly [strike]the most[/strike] much the loveliest of
people; & the best, perhaps; but also [strike]she was odd, she was[/strike]
[strike]so queer,[/strike] she was no more like [strike]th[/strike] what people thought her
[strike]than she was[/strike] than - no comparison came to Lilys mind,
& she wiped [strike]her[/strike] another brush; & began to scrape the
palette of all those mounds of blue & brown which she
knew she would never make do what she wanted,
& yet she would never give up trying to make them do
what she wanted; She was the very opposite of
what[strike]ever[/strike] she
all that - [strike]heroic,[/strike] submissive, devoted, sublime - She was like a
bird for speed; [strike]?or[/strike] like an arrow for decision - She was wilful &
stood
commanding.
She [strike]brooked[/strike] no contradiction. [strike]She[/strike]
(of course, Lily reminded herself, I am [strike]speaking[/strike] thinking of her
relations with women - with a woman who is much
younger than she is) - [strike]she was thinking,[/strike] [strike]for example,[/strike] of
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] open[strike]ing[/strike] all the bedroom windows; of
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay making up matches; of Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
of her determination to [strike]marry[/strike] [strike]one off;[/strike] [strike]of[/strike]
make [strike]one[/strike] [strike]a woman marry a[/strike] men, women marry;
her fixed single & simple belief that no career
She dictated all the doings of the day. Arriving late
at night, with a light tap on the door of one's bedroom,
wrapped in an old fur coat, how [strike]eloque[/strike] vehemently
[strike]dele[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike] how she would [strike]recount the[/strike] run over the tale of
things - sayings, doings, observations & [strike]oddities[/strike] of the day -
adroitly
& [strike]infallibly[/strike] shape them; & how she would insist, or
the
even not think it worth [strike]that[/strike]
trouble, that Lily [strike]would[/strike]
must [strike]of course[/strike] marry; 'must', since in the whole
world, whatever laurels might be tossed her, or
triumphs won by her, there could be no disputing this:
that an unmarried woman [strike]was[/strike] [strike]obviously[/strike] [strike]miserable.[/strike]
had missed the [strike]greatest of[/strike] best of life.

181
But [strike]Lil[/strike] Lily would protest, she could not leave her home;
her father; her [strike]sisters;[/strike] brothers; she would even dare, [strike]to[/strike] as the
white
night drew on, & [strike]between the[/strike] [strike]pale[/strike] light parted the
bedroom curtains, to [strike]proclaim the fact[/strike] [strike]her[/strike] deny for
herself [strike]at least the[/strike] the necessity of marriage; would
her own exemption
on the law
urge that Mrs. Ramsay's law did not apply to her;
& so
the a
have to meet [strike]that[/strike] [strike]serious,[/strike] [strike]intent, almost[/strike] exasperating
stare, [strike]w[/strike] from eyes [strike]which[/strike] [strike]with[/strike] [strike]all their beauty[/strike]
of unparalleled depth; [strike]& the[/strike] to [strike]front the[/strike] confront
Mrs. Ramsays [strike]perfectly[/strike] simple [strike]ex[/strike] conviction, Mrs. Ramsays
[strike]inscrutable[/strike] - [strike]entire[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] unshakable certainty, that she was a
fool.
The, Lily [strike]remembered,[/strike] it was [strike]hop[/strike] impossible; then she
lap one must
remembered, one had to lay one's head on her knee; & laugh -
[strike]until[/strike]
laugh - laugh - & Mrs. Ramsay said [?]
the thought of her
to laugh & laugh at Mrs. Ramsay, presiding so [strike]sternly so[/strike]
beautifully so unquestioningly [strike]over[/strike] yet somehow so
women
mistakenly over the destinies of [strike]others[/strike]. But into what
with simple
misunderstanding
sanctuary had one penetrated? Lily Briscoe had
[strike]made herself[/strike] looked up at last; & there was Mrs. Ramsay
unwitting entirely what caused her laughter, still presiding
[strike]serene;[/strike] [strike]but[/strike] [strike]on[/strike] but now with every trace [strike]of the[/strike] [strike]tyrant, of the[/strike]
wilfulness abolished; & in its place the calm of tropic

something soft as the

Was it [strike]tiredness[/strike]? Was it knowledge? Was [strike]there[/strike] it [strike]again[/strike]
?again
the deceptiveness of beauty, or did she lock up in her
own person that final knowledge [strike]of[/strike] which certainly Lily
Briscoe believed that [strike]some[/strike] people must have; for
it was not possible that all [strike]people[/strike] of [strike]us[/strike] should be as
or the word
did not
exist;
[strike]little[/strike] helter skelter as she was, [strike]living from hand to mouth,[/strike]

what they knew
could they [strike]communicate[/strike]?
Sitting on the floor, with her
arms round Mrs. [strike]B[/strike] Ramsay's knees,
[strike]she[/strike] close as she could
get, she imagined how in the chambers of the

the
[strike]of that[/strike]

touching her,
(& she
hugged

tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which, if one penetrated
to those chambers one could spell out; but they would never

[strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike]
[strike]less[/strike] like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same?
[strike]Did nearness of the body achieve[/strike] Could the body
achieve it - [strike]mingling its[/strike] essences, fearlessly & wholly? or

Mr. Bankes was looking at her picture. [strike]She had exposed[/strike]
[strike]to the[/strike]
world something [strike]which[/strike] that another person should see what she
[strike]had stated there, & pronounce[/strike] had concocted [strike]& stated;[/strike] what [strike]was[/strike]

the residue of
something mysterious

& sudden exaltation at being able to discuss the matter

he had spent his honeymoon. Lily felt that there was nothing that
he would not give up in the cause of truth. It interested him, &
he would [strike]stand[/strike] give his best mind to the question [strike]of[/strike] which
[strike]vexed[/strike] her of [strike]this[/strike] the relations between one part of her picture
&
absorbed
[strike]to[/strike] another part of her picture. So that she put herself again
into position; again considered the thing as a whole.
Was the triangular purple perhaps too heavy,
so that the
[strike]light sky[/strike] sky became too light? [strike]How should one[/strike] &
[strike]link up[/strike] [strike]bridge the[/strike] [strike]connect the[/strike] two chief blocks of matter
[strike]so that[/strike] must somehow be joined together -
Ah well, she broke off returning again, apologetically to the
extreme modesty of [strike]?spinster art.[/strike] [strike]a painting[/strike] uneducated
womanhood; & took it off the easel
   [But her picture has been looked at; her picture
it had been placed
had been cut from her;
& had taken its place on the other
the obsequious
dejected
?deplorable
side [strike]of that deep &[/strike] of that horrid little ditch, [strike]where[/strike] which
[strike]that[/strike] men like Charles Tansley cut so indefatigably

But here was somebody who made it seem possible to paint a
picture; &, returning to the normal relationship
again; not

[strike]not [/strike]his extraordinary magnaminity,

[strike]how odd it was, sometimes[/strike] [strike]to[/strike] be which lightened the whole
of her horizon [strike]w[/strike] - for here was a man, & one of the most
brilliant too (she had heard Mr. Ramsay
[strike]desc[/strike] call him
who [strike]did not[/strike]
the most brilliant botanist in Europe)
would let one talk to him.
That was the sort of thing
that did happen, if one stayed with the Ramsays -
one lived for 30 year
believing this to be true; suddenly here
was
Mr. Bankes
- & one cd. talk about painting. [strike]Now with[/strike]

   For Cam grazed the easel by an inch; she would not stop for
Mr. Bankes & Lily Briscoe; though Mr. Bankes would have liked her to 
stop: she would not stop for her father whom also she grazed
by an inch; nor for her mother, who called Cam! as she
dashed past, [strike]For[/strike] She [strike]was off[/strike] [strike]For she wanted[/strike] -
or
She was off - [strike]She was[/strike] like a bird, a [strike]pu[/strike] bullet, an arrow,

at what she was directed, who could say? [strike]A vision, a[/strike]

thinking of something
different
   The little girls mind was completely [strike]vacant,[/strike] as Mrs.
Ramsay saw; & the message which Cam was to take to
Andrew &
kitchen.
Mildred in the [?guestroom/?question] - Have Miss Doyle & Mr. Rayley come back? -
had to be repeated twice, to be dropped into [strike]that[/strike] those [strike]extraord[/strike]
those [strike]extraordinary depths, at once so[/strike] that well, where if the
waters were clear they
simple
were
words
also so extraordinarily distorting
about
that, even as the [strike]words[/strike]
descended, one saw them twisting: [strike]from side to[/strike]
to the cook
[strike]side[/strike]
What message [strike]Cam[/strike]
would Cam deliver,
Mrs. Ramsay wondered?
And indeed it was only by [strike]a[/strike]
the use of a parrot like instinct
to make heaven
knew
& lying in the
what
[?pattern]
strangest order
upon the floor
which reproduced her mothers
words accurately [strike]without any[/strike]
deprived of all meaning
in a [strike]kind[/strike] an absent minded singsong
that Cam asked,
[strike]looking at[/strike] staring at Mrs. McLeod,
who [strike]was on a visit, & had[/strike]
had come to ask for blankets, &
wore bugles,
Have Andrew, Miss Doyle & Mr. Rayley
come back?
& not considering [strike]th[/strike]
So that [strike]when[/strike] the answer to Mrs. Ramsays
[strike]question[/strike] was that a very old woman was in the kitchen who
wore bugles.
& [strike]not[/strike] not

reply - No -
they have not

Mrs. McLeod had come to get her blankets, Mrs. Ramsay divined, - [strike]She[/strike] for her
who
[strike]whose[/strike] mother was dying of cancer - but as for the message
about Andrew & the others, [strike]that[/strike] [strike]that could[/strike] the answer to that
[strike]could only be[/strike] was only to be reached by waiting patiently for
Cam to repeat, like a sleep walker, "No they haven't, & I've
told Ellen to clear away tea."
   Minta Doyle Paul Rayley had not come back. And
?Then/?You
[strike]what did that mean?[/strike]
It could only mean, Mrs. Ramsay thought,
that something had happened - that she had made up her
mind, that there was an end of all those hesitations which,
go on
indefinitely
while they did her honour, could not be[strike] prolonged[/strike] [strike]without[/strike]

[strike]Either[/strike] she must accept [strike]him[/strike], or she must refuse

right, of course
for nothing needed
more care,

And this going off after luncheon for a walk,
even though Andrew was with them, - what could it mean?
& she was very very
fond of Minta,
[strike]One did not[/strike] Except that [strike]after[/strike] she had decided, rightly,
Mrs. Ramsay thought, to accept Paul Rayley who was
obviously entirely devoted to her, a good fellow, [strike]&[/strike] one
yng fellows
of the nicest [strike]young men[/strike] she knew - which was not saying
of course that he was brilliant, for that he was not, but
it would be a [strike]very[/strike] happy marriage, Mrs. Ramsay thought, &
[strike]they would have very lovely babies,[/strike] & he would do well enough,
but that did not matter for he had prospects, &
[strike]& there would be lovely children, & in short Minta would be[/strike]
She She [strike]tried to seen[/strike] saw them going off after lunch,
[strike]down the path to the gate, &[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]tried to see Minta, with[/strike][strike][/strike]
she had no
doubt
[strike]the expression on Minta's[/strike]
[strike]face, & to the thought of which[/strike]

looking at the sky, wondering about wet or
fine, which she knew was only
to push them off
to cover their being shy; &
so she had said that there wasn't a

But [strike]then[/strike] perfect imbeciles are, she thought, [strike]need[/strike] necessary
sometimes - & it did not matter a fig -
[strike]However[/strike] - [strike]Those[/strike]

   Here James [strike]pointed[/strike] drew her attention to the
had just time
story of the Woodman's daughter, which they could possibly

finish before bed[strike]time[/strike] if Cam would only decide whether she
sit still
wanted to play in the garden, or to to hear about the little
girl who [strike]wanted to[/strike] had tea with the bears in the
[strike]middle of the[/strike] forest.
   And so they had gone off, Mrs. Ramsay remembered,
as she found her place, down the drive, & she rather thought
Nancy [strike]had[/strike] join[strike]ed[/strike] them, so there would be four of them, &
who knows whether, in the [strike]cir[/strike] circumstances, anything would

the [strike]moment[/strike] how difficult it is to stop talk, once it
begins, she knew; & here, at the ends of the earth as they
were, she was responsible to Minta's parents, if
Minta could be said to have parents, which Mrs.
Ramsay doubted: you could scarcely call [strike]that starched[/strike]
a man with a chin like that!
But had Nancy gone?

distracting the attention of [strike]that[/strike] Charles Tansley, Minta Doyle had
implored her to come, not in words; Minta was dumb; but
in speechless language which roused in Nancy's heart a
elation
an extraordinary [strike]ecstasy[/strike]. [strike]For[/strike] [strike]having no character[/strike] [strike]to speak of,[/strike]

Once a woman had accused her of
robbing her of her daughter's affection
& indeed she resented it, &
[strike]owed a grudge[/strike] possibly

at the head of the stairs. Between them they had produced, among
other children this perfectly incongruous creature, with this
passion for the open air & a hole, it seemed to Mrs. Ramsay,
perpetually
[strike]always[/strike] in the heel of her stocking.
Seeing her there in that

as
portentous atmosphere where,
[strike]it[/strike] [strike]seemed[/strike] to
Mrs. Ramsay, a maid

of that bird, Mrs. Ramsay had asked her to lunch, to dinner, to tea, to
stay with them finally - which had resulted in some friction with her mother,

only to be appeased by more calling, more conversation more gravel;
&
[strike]with[/strike] Mrs. Doyle for some reason suspected, her. Indeed, Mrs.

Ramsay divined that here was another [strike]occasion[/strike] occasion [strike]of[/strike]

She was accused of dominating, & [strike]of[/strike] interfering, [strike]of[/strike]
making people do her will rather than their own - a perfectly
genuinely believed;
baseless accusation;
Mrs. Ramsay thought, & yet if she had had
time & wealth, she would have liked to [strike]give[/strike] [strike]give expression to a[/strike]

to get a [strike]really good[/strike]

often milk was delivered at her
in a state which was possibly dangerous
to health, illegal; to

were older, she would have time [strike]for[/strike] perhaps for doing more -
ah, but she never wanted them to grow a day older!
They were adorable, just as they were; & it made her
miserable to see them growing
into long legged monsters -
Cam & James
they
had been
when

[strike]like[/strike] [strike]mere[/strike] bundles of delight - & she had been able to

but [strike]they were[/strike] it was Cam's fault mostly, because she was older, & a

Still, without being in vain, she hoped

was beautiful; Andrew - her husband thought he had an

the moment they cared for nothing but cricket & football, but
a perfect angel
of goodness to
the others - &
the only one who was
really beautiful
he was one of those
boys who care for

A child's power of happiness was something indescribable.
Cam could still be happy for days with a tenpenny tea set.
It seemed to Mrs. [strike]Ramsay that[/strike] T[strike]t[/strike]hey began early in the morning.
[strike]A ?ch sound of[/strike] Shouting & stamping began over her head in
the nursery about seven o'clock. Then they came [strike]burs[/strike]
bursting along the passages, & then the door sprang open &
in they came, James royally seated in Susie's arms;
Cam, plucking at her apron, [strike]both so sure[/strike] [strike]as if it[/strike]
staring,
both [strike]g[/strike] wide awake,
as if this coming into the dining room
after breakfast were
a positive event to them - & so on,
all day long; till she went up to say good night, & found
them netted into their cots, like birds among cherries &
strawberries, [strike]still crowing & shouting with[/strike] flushed &
mischievous, & still so [strike]happy that, as she[/strike] entirely &

He [strike]was[/strike] [strike]could not[/strike] did not like her to take what he called

& perhaps
anyhow, making
phrases was a
great alleviation,

& she wished she
had the power, but
more robust perhaps,
not that she did despair, even of some
sort of final arrangement
by which the tragedies & sorrows
should be made [strike]up,[/strike] good:
it was only that if one did not
accept the usual beliefs
& if one had lived, as she had, fifty

[strike]on the whole,[/strike] something of the suffering that
went on - for instance among the poor, & [strike]in one[/strike] [strike]had[/strike]

made neither into
worn
a beautiful beauty nor into habit: but had [strike]kept[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] sharp &
uncompromising, at [strike]the[/strike] her heart, like a hair shirt)
   Then, how could one be thoughtlessly,
about wh people
debated - had it
any real existence
or not? -
it happened
to be in [?truth]
205
completely, rapturously happy, like those heavenly children, who
have her way
must
[strike]would[/strike] grow up & lose it all?
If she could
arrange it, James &
Cam should always remain like this - sitting beside her, listening to
the story of the woodman's daughter. [strike]Indeed, she[/strike] She would like [u]always[/u]
to have a baby: though indeed she had no right to have had
how much
it meant
eight, considering that [strike]it meant a good deal of[/strike] anxiety - [strike]how to g[/strike]
giving all the boys a proper education - & there was the
greenhouse roof that wanted mending; & it meant that he
had to make some money [strike]every year to supplement their income;[/strike]
though she was resolved that he should never [strike]desert his[/strike]
[strike]have[/strike] to give up his own [strike][?][/strike] [strike]special[/strike] work, his philosophy - [strike]that[/strike]
however hard
they were pressed
pursuit of the letter Z [strike]which still escaped him[/strike] - [strike]As for[/strike]
[strike]herself, she[/strike] For that was the most important of all things
& she could manage somehow.
   Anyhow, Minta Doyle would miss the best thing in the
whole world if she had no children. Of that Mrs. Ramsay
was
?one
positive. Argument was [strike]so[/strike] silly - how could [strike]you[/strike] argue?
[strike]Sometimes she[/strike] Anyone wilfully missing or putting aside for
[strike]any reason[/strike] that side of life was so [strike]pitia[/strike] profoundly to be pitied
that Mrs. Ramsay for one almost thought that the State
the chance
of motherhood
should make some arrangement by which every woman had
[strike]at least[/strike] the opportunity - [strike]Only[/strike] But [strike]sh[/strike] there remained
of course something else - [strike]that[/strike] relationship of man & woman
[strike]which[/strike] husband & wife. Minta was perfectly right to think it over.
Nothing would induce Mrs. Ramsay to hurry her: she must
remind herself, she must curb herself, she must, whatever
of the
happened, check that masterfulness which, she admitted
was in her, [strike]here;[/strike] [strike]she must[/strike] [strike]for once she[/strike] had made a
match, & she had regretted it. It was one of the things she blamed
herself for

[strike]So[/strike] the little girl was carried up to bed, & fell fast asleep [strike]until she[/strike]
& dreamed of [strike]the forest.[/strike] all night of the bears in the forest.
And thats the end, she said, shutting the book. [strike]&[/strike]
[u]X[/u]
   The children were not
anxious -
She must [strike]face[/strike] get up & find out [strike]about[/strike]
[strike]whether[/strike]
Even as she [strike]could hardly[/strike] sit still
possessed by that sudden fear,
that picture of disaster, of somebody
falling, & [strike]ask[/strike] find out; but
they were not anxious [strike]in the least,[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike] they were quite absorbed, still, by the story; both of them sitting
perfectly still & [strike]looking[/strike] then she saw what was it? - something
extraordinarily beautiful; a sort of wonder in their faces; an
a look of awe, of rapture, as if both of them [strike]had[/strike] they had
[strike]been[/strike] there had mingled with the dying strains of the fairy story
some new astonishing pleasure. It was the lighthouse.
Yes, they
the lighthouse had been lit, & they could see it rather pale at first, in the
slow
making its three strokes across the bay: the
[strike]long[/strike] one first; then the
two quick ones. But James would begin to [strike]think about his[/strike]
disappointment; they were not going there, his father said;
Happily here was Mildred, come to take them to bed: before he
remembered.
Off they trotted, for nobody would carry
James any [strike]more.[/strike] &
Theres the lighthouse she said, [strike]loo[/strike]
Yes, it was beginning; rather pale still in the halflight; like [strike]a[/strike]
indeed it looked almost like very [strike]pale[/strike] sun [strike]beams, & it only[/strike] still,
just touching the waves.
   Where is he? thought Mrs. Ramsay - she looked for
her husband.
211
[u]Feb. 22nd[/u]
[u]X[/u]
   The children were not anxious. They were absorbed still by the story.
One could almost see them both pondering those last words about
the little girl dreaming of the bears; & then, as that [strike]story[/strike] faded,
[strike]suddenly[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay saw [strike]them, both[/strike] come into their eyes
it was
some new wonder - Oh the lighthouse! [strike]Yes, they had[/strike]
something pale,
ecstatic
lit [strike]the lighthouse. That[/strike] Turning she looked across the [strike]B[/strike] bay,
& there, sure enough, was that pale light, which, at the moment,
almost
light
one might mistake for sunshine;
but it came & went, over

[strike]the sea: first[/strike] only it came & went, [strike]a first[/strike] two quick
strokes & then one long steady stroke, silvering the waves faintly,
for it was still light.
begin to ask whether they were
   James would think about going to the lighthouse: [strike]his[/strike]
& they were not going to the Lighthouse: his father said it was impossible
out [strike]of the question:[/strike]
But happily, here was Mildred
[strike]he[/strike] he wd. think
[?gloomily]
to ?take in
off
them to bed; [strike]but Cam[/strike] & then, she
trusted he would forget
all
about going to the Lighthouse.
But she doubted it.
Children never forgot anything.
   No, [strike]they forget nothing,[/strike] she thought, putting together some
pictures
he had cut out
of the bits of paper that were strewn

[strike]about the floor,[/strike] - the
refrigerator, the
gentleman in the yellow shirt front, the
mowing machine, -
& taking her knitting.
They forgot nothing.
But
She sighed.
It was a great relief when they did go to bed.
For now she [strike]was[/strike]
need not think about anybody for a
moment
She could be herself, by herself; & that was what now she
had [strike]come[/strike] often felt the need of - to
to think. [strike]What then was it?[/strike] To be alone.
And as it
happened that she was more often left alone in the evening,
be
[strike]the[/strike] it was familiar to her to watching that lighthouse, as she
was [strike]sewing[/strike] knitt[strike]ing[/strike]ed; [strike]& it was[/strike] the two quick strokes & then

& ?it
still
the long stroke. The [strike]And[/strike] Of the three strokes it was the [strike]third[/strike]
really felt in sympathy with. The third stroke was
[?], looking
up from
her knitting
at
think, well, not even
213
that [strike]with[/strike] which [strike]seemed[/strike] to her the real one; if it could be said
that one thing was more [strike][?][/strike] real than another thing It was
like that - [strike]quite ruthless, quite direct[/strike] - [strike]And[/strike] For she had a
sense of [strike]their[/strike] there [strike]being[/strike] something in one, in her at least,
the one she was so
tired of
more real, most real, herself[strike];[/strike] ? [strike]or[/strike] no no: not the self that went about
[strike]but[/strike] not ever
doing things; & not the self here, now, in this room; [strike]yes,[/strike] &
when there was no one to be nice to; no children; no husband; for that ?did ?not,
Or was it life?
but
Then [strike]was[/strike] one was rather awful, she thought,
that ruthless direct stroke, that third stroke, [strike]which[/strike] was [strike]what[/strike]
the real one, & [strike]as[/strike] one [strike]did not[/strike] could not escape. Children never
forget. What we have done, we have done. but the shelf which was
at the beck & call - could one deny it? - of - She [strike]did not know[/strike]
never had a word for it, she was singularly dumb; she thought of it
third stroke
as that - there - the long [strike]direct[/strike] [strike]ruthless stroke[/strike]
Children never
enough
She woke up in the
night & saw it stroking
[strike]crossing[/strike] the floor
forget; [strike]she knew that perfectly well; & the lighthouse had[/strike]
[strike]nothing to teach her about that: No.[/strike]
for example: she was
all
growing old; for example: [strike]&[/strike] they would die, & it would be over.
Well?
And [strike]who was going to deny[/strike] that?
She looked over [strike]the[/strike] her
knitting, [strike]when she said to her husband, how at the back of her[/strike]
[strike]mind she did not despair, there was that, just that.[/strike]
[strike]Merely, she supposed, every rational person in the course of[/strike]
[strike]life achieves what is after all only common sense:[/strike] they said
(her mother said) We are in the hands of the Lord; Sshe never
had
[strike]had[/strike] the least inclination to say that. We are in the hands
of the Lord - How could any Lord create a world of such [strike]suffering[/strike]
pain
such horrible injustice? But the Lighthouse was
quite
a [strike]little[/strike] different. It was
[strike]perfectly[/strike] ruthless; [strike]but it was[/strike]
doubt
nobody had any [strike]illusions[/strike] about that, [strike]but[/strike] it came; it went;
&, flowing
& [strike]somehow,[/strike] [strike]as one grew[/strike]
[strike]older one learnt felt that very[/strike] thing [strike]in ones[/strike]
[strike]bones.[/strike] itself was in one bones. It had her own expression.

She was like it.
Her eyes she felt were full of it:
[strike]that[/strike] It drew her to it.
For [strike]when she was quite alone,[/strike] it [strike]was[/strike] odd, being alone,
how surprisingly strong [strike]the[/strike] one finds [strike]some[/strike] those [?thing]
then
almost forgotten & perfectly foolish feelings - ?&
is
215
community with things which have no bearing upon one's life at all.
Flowers, yes; & some lonely places, where [strike]she, who was hardly ever[/strike]
alone
?one
alone, went down to ?drink, [strike]laying aside her clothes at the rivers' edge,[/strike]
[?ones]
?there
ones
putting off [strike]the[/strike] [strike]greenhouse[/strike] clothes, laying aside clothes
That was what she would consider, when they were all grown up; & she
?how it
had time. [strike]Then[/strike] S[strike]s[/strike]he would get it straight.
She would find out what it
how there is
other relationship; not

between herself
how there is one
relation: James & her
husband: another,
herself &
the other relationship, of mind [strike]&[/strike] what did one call it?
She
[strike]held[/strike] stopped knitting.
She [strike][?][/strike] gazed again, with some irony in her
interrogation, at that [strike]lovely[/strike] cryptic light:
that silent light; [strike]that[/strike]
which was silvering the waves a little more brightly, as
daylight faded.
She had for it some irrational tenderness;
it gave her, as it gave her
children, some queer ecstasy; [strike]some ?&[/strike] the
sight of [strike]that[/strike]
those lights, the two quick lights & then
the long light, which
say what you like (& as for her husband, he would say, quite tenderly,
gave her
that it was nonsense)
such happiness as almost transcended
worry & loss: how they had not come back: & might be killed.
For [strike]if[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] there was no treachery too base for the world [strike]not[/strike] to
commit: of that she was well aware. All she replied to
the worlds treachery was, (& she [strike]grasped her stock[/strike] knitted
with her firm composure, & a little pressure of the lips)
But she made no reply.

She watched the lighthouse for a
minute or two. [strike]There was no reply.[/strike]
For in asking this or that of

in

life,

praying questioning, mo one

must have at one's command

[strike]made[/strike]
[strike]language, which she[/strike]
[strike]had not; one must be[/strike]
[strike]made differently; for[/strike]
[strike]in her[/strike]
[strike]for she never saw things, or formulated things; but[/strike]
[strike]only opposed to fate, what she[/strike]
[strike]?was, that she did not[/strike]
[strike]by any means give way; & was able to understand without moving[/strike]
[strike]from her chair[/strike]
[strike]altogether[/strike]
was [strike]to[/strike] this twofold nature; [strike]of the[/strike][strike][/strike]
217
of the three strokes.
The third stroke was her stroke; but what did she mean by that?
She was singularly dumb. She found herself sitting & looking,
sitting & looking, until she almost became the thing she looked at.
And she
said to herself;
I am
it will all have to end.
Children never forget, [strike]she[/strike] was growing old;
[strike]we are[/strike] in the hands of 
no she never said that
the Lord. - But
[strike]though she used those words,[/strike] [strike]she[/strike] did not mean
And the light [strike]went[/strike]
came [strike]&w[/strike] & went;
it was ruthless; it
had no pity; & it
[strike]part[/strike] had become
part of her thoughts
but the futility
of the words
seemed to
& it was not that.
for a tree, for a
stream,
for anything;
as for
oneself;
a lake
She [strike]gazed[/strike]
why one fel
anything
like
that
Mysterious
word
Mystery of oneself, ones
The bride & the lover -
the relation
between
oneself & it - &
being it
?with [?] times so
[strike]or[/strike]
them at all; [strike]but[/strike] No.
[strike]She was much felt much more[/strike]
[strike]in sympathy with the long third stroke, which she saw[/strike]
[strike]bent, half on the bed, half on the floor, when she woke up[/strike]
[strike]at night.[/strike]
[strike]She looked up over her knitting.[/strike]
[strike]How[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]could any Lord have made a world like this? And[/strike][strike][/strike]
And
[strike][strike]Precisely.[/strike][/strike]
She looked up over her knitting, meeting the third
stroke which [strike]somehow[/strike] seemed
to her like her own eyes meeting her
own eyes; & [strike]yet of course[/strike] [strike]for[/strike]
It was odd how when one was alone
that they expressed things
in one, became part of one,
[strike]some[/strike] one felt these leanings towards
things which had no
bearing on ones own life; [strike]so that one[/strike]
[strike]attributed[/strike]
how one felt [strike]that[/strike] irrational tenderness; how one felt ([strike]that[/strike]
just sitting here alone knitting) as if inside, far down,
there rose up like a wraith, like a mist curling off
rising
water, some ghost, [strike]some[/strike] bride,
to meet the lover.
She was
[strike]Indeed what happened was simply[/strike]
[strike]When[/strike] [strike]She[/strike] She would try
to get it all straight one of these
days, when they were
all grown up; - For [strike]certainly[/strike] [strike]there was a[/strike]
when
&
like this
the children went to bed,
she sat knitting, alone; [strike]then[/strike] &
[strike]then[/strike] she [strike]liked[/strike] to be
[strike]sure that there was something there:[/strike]
[strike]what[/strike] found [strike]this[/strike]
[strike]thing in her; she found herself & as she[/strike]

[strike]was sitting here, she connected naturally with the[/strike]
[strike]lighthouse;[/strike] &
[strike]Often[/strike]
things in her: & looking at the lighthouse,
[strike]she connected it[/strike]
she had that queer association; no doubt
some people
had it,
but
with the light, which [strike]was so[/strike]
as it [strike]came & went, seemed to have her[/strike]
just seemed to her -
what could she [strike]call[/strike] it? -
B
[strike]For[/strike]
how could any Lord
have made this world? How indeed?
with its vice, its
torture. [strike]No;[/strike]
They had not come back. They might be
killed.
There was no treachery too base for
the world to commit.
Of that she
219
[strike]was aware[/strike]. No baseness too despicable even in men & women.
No
that lasted
[strike]And ?their[/strike] happiness [strike]was not lasting.[/strike] [strike]And they[/strike]
She [strike]turned her[/strike] She knitted with firm composure, slightly [strike]p[/strike]
pursing her lips, so that when Mr. Ramsay passed her, [strike]?he[/strike]
though he was thinking [strike]of Hume &[/strike] how Hume having grown
fat
?as
enormously stout, stuck in a bog, he could not help [strike]but[/strike]
making a note of that severity, which was part of her beauty, -
stroke
[strike]There was her light again, the third stroke.[/strike][strike][/strike]
It was [strike]the[/strike] long
[strike]third stroke, direct & im -[/strike]
[strike]And she thought with a[/strike]
the soul of it, the
flame.
Yet it
distressed him.
[strike]sort of carelessness which in the she could was entirely[/strike]
she thought
Nothing she minded for herself,
[strike]No happiness[/strike] And they must die.
For herself she
quite reckless.
[strike]That indeed was[/strike] one [strike]of[/strike] thing that struck her -
how reckless
she cd. ?have
?been
probably if it were not for the children, she was
reckless: [strike]rather[/strike] unscrupulous, as in this matter of arranging
marriages; [strike]& rather[/strike] intolerant of restriction [strike]If she had been rich[/strike]
If she had had more money - if she had been for example, Lady So & So -
She stopped knitting. She gazed with some irony in her
interrogation, some veiling of her eye, at that [strike]cry[/strike] steady
light, that remorseless light, [strike]which was however was so[/strike]
[strike]searching, so pure[/strike] [strike]& its[/strike] which ?was so much her; [strike]And yet[/strike]
& so little her at the same [strike]time;[/strike] had her at its beck & call,
perhaps; but for all that
she
[strike]was extremely conscious[/strike] - she
[strike]I dont[/strike] she did
not find
it easy to give in -
watching it
thought watching it silvering the waves a little more
brightly as daylight faded - she [strike]never[/strike] could [strike]not[/strike]
[strike]a[/strike] abdicate [strike]her own power, as some people could, she[/strike]
[strike]she never did submit:[/strike] [strike]her own[/strike] she [strike]was not[/strike] did not find it
easy to give way - & [strike]her[/strike] it came & rolling [strike]pur[/strike]
waves of pure lemon, [strike]lovely & ethereal,[/strike] upon the beach.
[strike]For[/strike]
[strike]And yet[/strike]
For
they
it distressed [strike]him,[/strike] Mr. Ramsay, passing again -
[strike]not her[/strike] [strike]she[/strike] not that her temperament [strike]was[/strike]
[strike]should[/strike]
had part in
that severity
it
in
[strike]among oth[/strike] [strike]with all its simple[/strike] he [strike]found[/strike]
[strike]tinged with[/strike] melancholy
But he felt that he would not like to interrupt her: there
are moments of [strike]great[/strike] estrangement:
the [strike]fits of[/strike] irritability
she did not
scorn
envy

221
beauty in her
mind but
& all its beauty
[strike]was[/strike] burnt in her, as in her childrens
eyes; such ecstasy
[strike]there was for her &[/strike]
[strike]such irrational joy.[/strike] of joy,
or from wonder
at beauty
[strike]between them. She passed sometimes out of his reach. He could not[/strike]
w
[strike]like to interrupt her For him, there was something awful, suddenly, in[/strike]
Nor could [strike]he reach[/strike] her, nor save her, nor protect her even from the
negation of his own miserable importunities: his demands; his
irritability.
Hume stuck in a bog & an old woman [strike]only[/strike]
rescued him on condition he said the Lords Prayer.
He snorted out his sudden laugh as he passed her He was not sure
how far that story would
go down at Cardiff.
He would ask [strike]his wife[/strike] her.
But he would
[strike]take her hand[/strike] & put it to his
lips,
with his
extraordinary charm,
his
extreme sympathy,
[strike]asking her, to[/strike]
[strike]forgive him, saying to her[/strike]
his directness which
disarmed her always,
& [strike]that[/strike] what could he

whether she thought that
Mrs. Bowley [strike]was[/strike] would be shocked
(For they were staying with the Bowleys at Cardiff)
   "Hume grew to be very fat, &
It awed
him; it
saddened him;

It distressed him; it saddened him, Mr. Ramsay thought, passing a second
the spasms of
time. He could not save her; he could not protect her not even
from his own miserable irritability. [strike]He had been[/strike]
[strike]annoyed[/strike] foolishly irritated
about
the Lighthouse

intolerable

thoughts. He had [strike]this[/strike] [strike]these[/strike]
his
lectures to write. "And Hume,
grown very fat stuck in a bog & an old woman rescued him
on condition he said the Lord's Prayer" -
He drew up
& snorting a queer snort of laughter, beside the window, wanting
[strike]He wanted[/strike] to ask [strike]her[/strike] his wife if he could tell that story at
Cardiff.
[strike]But[/strike] But as even Lily Briscoe allowed, in
[strike]her w[/strike] those moment of violent irritation with Mr. Ramsay
which, occurring at breakfast for example, when he
behaved with more than usual blindness to the feelings of
others, when he was more than usually bleak, cutting &
disagreeable - so that her egg spoon trembled in her hand, &
she flushed with anger - [strike]if she, &[/strike] even she, at that
moment had to admit ([strike]if [/strike]directly she looked up) that
[strike]he was[/strike] there was a scrupulosity about him: he never
[strike]devoured [?downed] you;[/strike] over came your privacy: but on the contrary, had some sort of
[strike]even in[/strike] perfect manners; not politeness; but [strike]integrity[/strike]
[strike]breeding[/strike] (only it was difficult to find words for what she
meant, save that she could have gone to him [strike]for[/strike] in a
crisis - say, if she wished to become a Roman Catholic [strike])[/strike]
so now,
& he would have respected her personality -) [strike]but,[/strike] [strike]though[/strike]
though he wished to speak to [strike]her,[/strike] his wife he did not
like to interrupt her.
He could not protect her, alas. And
it was Mrs. Ramsay
who looked at him; Mrs. Ramsay whose
lips parted; as she
resumed her knitting & Mrs.
Ramsay who returned[strike], &[/strike]
to him, & resumed intercourse with him

of her own free will, oh yes; for he was wanting her to come out into the
garden with him, wanting her, but would not [strike]for an instant[/strike] break in

   To save going upstairs she pulled the green shawl off the
easel, &, wrapping it round her, took his arm for a stroll.

year - & whether t[strike]o employ that[/strike] go on employing Kennedy, the

at Cardiff, whether they would be shocked if her [strike]?rem[/strike] stayed at an
Inn; [strike]for[/strike] [strike]when he[/strike] [strike]& not with them,[/strike]

boredom of their [strike]evening[/strike] [strike]parties[/strike]
domestic evenings; [strike]&[/strike]

air gun.
[strike]It was a horrible instinct,[/strike] [strike]but[/strike]

Poor Carmichael
seemed tolerably cheerful, though it might be better not to

Mrs. Ramsay, would have been her refuge had she married

[strike]She had him a[/strike]

The atheist -
the little atheist -
He was not a polished specimen,

She supposed it was all right.

She [strike]had heard[/strike]
a good deal
said
about that, Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]said.[/strike] rather significantly;
But
then, said Mr. Ramsay, it was all he had to count on.
said Mrs. Ramsay
stopping to consider
her dahlias.
At any rate, Prue would not marry him If she did, he
would disinherit her tomorrow, said Mr. Ramsay, but added
that there was no harm in the
youth: he was not
&
about
prepossessing.
[strike]But[/strike] as
he was
the only young man who [strike]was[/strike]

read his - Mr. Ramsays -
books.
But it was a question of Kennedy,
the gardener - She
could never be sure that he planted the bulbs she sent

him.
Resolved no to [strike]worry[/strike] her with his own affairs again,
[strike]Mr. R[/strike] & priding himself for his forbearance, Mr. Ramsay
observed that the hot pokers seemed creditable.
But
then Mrs. Ramsay had planted the hot pokers with her
own hands.
If she stood over him with a spade all
day long he occasionally did do something.
She was
teaching her daughters to exaggerate, [strike]he said.[/strike] Mr Ramsay said.
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]owned that she had[/strike] said that [strike]it[/strike]
her great Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was.
But nobody ever held up Aunt Camilla as a model of
her
virtue, said Mr. Ramsay. [strike]Well,[/strike] she was the most
beautiful woman of her time, said Mrs. Ramsay.
Somebody else was
that, said Mr. Ramsay.
?Nonsense
[strike]Nonsense[/strike]
Her daughter would be far more beautiful than she was,
said Mrs. Ramsay.
He could see no trace of that
[strike]whatever,[/strike] said Mr. Ramsay.
[strike]Andrew is[/strike] How proud [strike][?][/strike]
they would be when Andrew was Senior Wrangler, said
Mrs. Ramsay.
She had better not fix her [strike]heart[/strike] thoughts upon
that said Mr. Ramsay (But it was he who dreamt of it
all night long) she [strike]thought examinations so silly[/strike] -
not
He should look
at Prue
tonight then,
said Mrs.
Ramsay.
she thought examining boys [strike]simply[/strike] idiotic. [strike]But[/strike]
only that she

to do it.
229
Her folly really passed belief, said Mr. Ramsay. If Andrew got a
scholarship, either at Balliol or at Trinity it would be something
to be proud of. The idea of being proud of him because he got a
scholarship! - she was proud of him [strike]just[/strike] as he was.
Did he not think it very late - rather late, - for [strike]those[/strike] them
still
[strike]young people[/strike] to be out?

so
And he wished to tell her, when he was
walking on the terrace [strike]he thought she looked so sad.[/strike]
he did not like to see her looking [strike][?][/strike] - so - sad
   [strike]Oh[/strike] I was half asleep - woolgathering, she said.
& standing in the gap between the hot pokers they
looked at the Bay
231
he began again -
[strike]how[/strike] it had pained him - just now on the terrace - that she should look [strike]so[/strike] sad
[strike]sad;[/strike] But she was only woolgathering she said flushing a little, ?after
He did not like her
reading fairy tales to the children.
She should not look sad;
[strike]so[/strike]
not that he meant quite that
he repeated; but he did not mean

explain why she

why it pained him;

[strike]quite what he said,[/strike]
but [strike]that he could not[/strike]
She had not been
exactly sad.
Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought,
she would never have been thinking about such things -
There was the Lighthouse again, for they had reached the
red

& the
There were the sandhills. And there, on the left the

of

up almost
silver water which were held firm.
And all the
torture, all the vice, Mrs. Ramsay thought, looking
at the
town & thinking of the old woman dying there, had turned
to
silver lights; & there was nothing to mark all that [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]knew of[/strike] the poverty [strike]&[/strike] the vice & the hardness of their lives -
but those lights which, rising into the air, & suspended
soul
the
above the houses, [strike]marked[/strike] seemed like [strike]the net of a city[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]a symbol, a phantom;[/strike] the thing which rises from the
the little streets;
the hot bedrooms
[strike]body, & is as[/strike] like a [strike]net floating[/strike] a starry net floating
there to mark the position of the little town.
   There was no reason whatever to be anxious, said
Mr. Ramsay. At Andrews age, he used to walk all day
with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket.
Mrs. Ramsay said that
she
could [strike]quite[/strike] believe him capable of any
[strike]such[/strike]
absurdity.
He
was still capable of almost any absurdity. [strike]He had[/strike]
[strike]But she knew that he growing old. He & he[/strike][strike][/strike]
but
[strike]knew it,[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]would not allow it. He would not[/strike]
But H[strike]h[/strike]e
[strike]was[/strike] was nettled at the thought that he was growing old.
He [strike]would[/strike] could put a biscuit in his pocket, walk all

But he knew that he would never
do that again: & it annoyed
him;
it angered him; that
233
she did not even contradict him.
[strike]for[/strike]
She knew that it would never do it.
She prevented him; she restrained him. For years ago [strike]he had been[/strike]
before he married, he had been reckless. Had he cared then whether he had
sat down soaked to his bread & cheese? Had he cared [strike]for[/strike] how [strike]long he[/strike]
far he went, or [strike]how[/strike] whether he worked all night or not?

&
never a human
being to interrupt
you all day long.
Where you
could
[strike]There was the[/strike]
[strike]sea, breaking[/strike]
little sandy
beach where [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]even[/strike] no one had
been since the
beginning of the
world
There, on the far side of the bay, dwindling away into
darkness, w[strike]h[/strike]ere the sandhills. There was the lonely country
he loved best. [strike]Those h[/strike] with never a house or a signpost or a
village; nothing [strike]but tracks over the hills, & so that you[/strike]
walk a while day without meeting a soul.
[strike]And suddenly[/strike]

We know nothing, he [strike]sai[/strike] murmured
to himself, [strike]for[/strike] & seemed
to be
on the familiar [?] of the

We stand on the edge of a precipice [strike]looking into the abyss.[/strike]
in his abstraction
he murmured;
[strike]but[/strike]
without meaning it, he [strike]could[/strike] said [strike]the[/strike]
whispered
[strike]last words[/strike] "the edge of a precipice" above his breath; & instantly
repented. He had no right. She was there. The parents of eight
children, he [strike]recalled[/strike] recollected; of eight sons & daughters - &
[strike]had no[/strike] have no choice.
[u]They[/u] would see to it, he thought;
meaning that [strike]they at least[/strike] - his Andrew & his Prue & all
the rest of them, not least that obstinate little beggar James
[strike]with his[/strike] would somehow put off the day of reckoning
would [strike]stave[/strike] stem the flood a bit; [strike]would[/strike] were the best
token he could give - they could give - his wife & himself -
that they did not damn the poor little universe
entirely; [strike]this poor speck of matter; this little crag,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]with girt by floods;[/strike] for one reason why he loved [strike]Finlay was[/strike]
[strike]that[/strike] these remote islands was that [strike]this poor little island[/strike]
[strike]Indeed he could be[/strike]
They
[strike]It[/strike] had a pathetic smallness, on an
evening like this.
The little islands seemed [strike]vanish[/strike]
swallowed up in the sea.
"Poor little town", he murmured
looking at the village
   "On the edge of a precipice", Mr. Ramsay thought.
He said the most melancholy things & [strike]always[/strike] [strike]he,[/strike] she noticed,
always
directly he had said them, he was
particularly cheerful.
[strike]He seemed always to be playing a game[/strike] -
It was like a game
to him

[strike]But she liked his games[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]she & she believed in them odd[/strike]

[strike]as they were; she believed that he was[/strike]
[strike]And after all they[/strike]
[strike]agreed on the most important points.[/strike]

[strike]said, he should have shot himself long ago.[/strike]
[strike]But he as it was[/strike]
[strike]he seemed to become more cheerful.[/strike]
He ought to be ashamed of
himself, she said,
[strike]It was a[/strike] [strike]to stand there, on a night like this,[/strike]
[strike]to complain on a night like this,[/strike] to talk of precipices on a night
like this, & all the children well: & so good; & so full of promise.
237
They turned away from the view, & began to walk up the [strike]drive, w[/strike] path
[strike]which[/strike] was [strike]bordered with silvery green thick leaved plants,[/strike]
by the flower beds where they grew [strike]clumps of[/strike] spear like plants,

   Mr. Bankes was saying that he had been to Amsterdam. He
had seen the Rembrandts. He had been to Madrid. Unfortunately,
it was Good Friday, & he had not see the Prado.
He had been to
Rome. Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome? Oh she should
try to go to Rome. It would be a wonderful experience for her -
the Sistine Chapel; Michael Angelo: & Siena, with its [strike]car[/strike] Giottos.

in their unconsciousness - for they were looking at Prue throwing
catches - so awe inspiring & moving to the emotions, so that
Lily thought how she saw now what Mrs. Ramsay meant about

like effects, & for [strike]the[/strike] while [strike]the marine curiosities are equally[/strike]
[strike]they are remarkable for the[/strike] for the extent & variety of their
marine curiosities".
So [strike]quoting the guide book, & in[/strike]
[strike]the highest spirits[/strike] [strike]which roused Andrew's suspicions slightly,[/strike]
[strike]for there it would not do[/strike], [strike][/strike][strike]to this rout of shoutings[/strike]
But it would not do altogether, this shouting & damning your eyes,
Andrew felt: picking his way down the path in front of them;
[strike]the[/strike] & the sudden friendliness, the clapping him on the back, the
altogether do, was the worst of taking Rayley & Minta Doyle,
calling him old fellow, the laughing too
easily,
all this would not
on
in an expedition together.
So indeed, they separated;
it came about somehow. They said they were going to
explore
the caves; but as 'the marine curiosities for which these
islands are justly celebrated', are found only
[strike]out[/strike] on rocks
[strike]which the sea comes[/strike]
[strike]exposed to the[/strike] covered
at high tide,
he was not going in to the caves; but taking off
his socks he
out onto
rolled them up in his boots & set off barefoot;
[strike]over[/strike] the pope's nose
[strike]rocks.[/strike]
Nancy [strike]would follow[/strike]; [strike]but she[/strike] [strike]but first she[/strike] wanted [strike]to[/strike] first to
find shells; pointed shells [strike]with green[/strike] lights
in them to
[strike]stick on boxes;[/strike]
or glass; or veined stones; or cowries, perhaps,
for Cam's collection.
[strike]but she scrambled[/strike] too, to [strike]Andrew[/strike]
the [strike]big rock, wi[/strike]
[strike]Then, if Andrew did the Popes Nose, she would[/strike]
[strike]do the Devil's hoof -[/strike]
[strike]so they called it;[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] for
then she searched too
into the deep [strike]little[/strike] rock pools,
where the sea anemones
flowered, the red & the yellow,
streaming their tentacles in
the [strike]deep[/strike] current of the deep inland
sea, [strike]when[/strike] where swam the
whales & the sharks, she thought,
converting the pool into the
depths of the ocean;
covering its sky
with her hand so as to bring disaster -
desolation,
[strike]to its[/strike] & then uncovering it to the sun
beat down.
She

[strike]something extraordinary appeared,[/strike] wonderful ?marlins/?martins appeared - she shouted
for Andrew. He told her to mark the place: he would come over in
half a jiffy.
But they slid into crevices: ?scaled/?sealed ?marlins/?martins
all fresh & glowing with their extravagant eccentricity &
[strike]charm, something[/strike] fantastic & high stepping - they
shrank
silently
retreated, [strike]in[/strike] a
Nancy marking the crevice where he had disappeared,
watched from her rock that slightly irregular line of the
their highstepping
legs, their
fringes, their
gauntlets,
their [?]
?being
horizon: the waving the stems [strike]which[/strike]
that
were the smoke of steamers; & so
was overcome with the power of the waves, & their sullenness &
[strike]their indifference.[/strike]
[strike]As they she thought, nobody had ever been[/strike]
[strike]been[/strike] breaking round her. [strike]As she thought, this would go on;[/strike]
[strike]go on for ever & ever; the waves breaking, & swirling into the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]booming in the caves.[/strike]
Filled with scorn, & the
sweeping savagely up & then inevitably withdrawing.
As she thought, this would go on, go on for ever & ever. [strike]What[/strike]
   Andrew shouted to her to get back to the beach, as
the sea was coming in.
So she took off her shoes &
stockings; took off the shoes & stockings of this negligible &
phantom
evanescent
spirit; &
as she rolled the stockings & put
them in the
shoes, she felt the
sea in
her heart; the content of
in her veins
&
in her mind
the sea; & [strike]its[/strike]
the power of the sea; &
the nothingness [strike]of life; & her own[/strike]
power to [strike]ride the[/strike] [strike]bestride the universe;[/strike]
of the terror of life; & the
horror of life; & the life; & so stepped through the water on [strike]the[/strike] to
the shingle; & there - there they [strike]we behind the rock[/strike] kissing behind
Paul Rayley & Minta Doyle [strike]were[/strike] kissing.
And Andrew
fish
should, had she marked her [strike]rock[/strike]
& they went out
again to look for the fringed gauntletted, high stepping fish:
He had seen it too:
& seen enough.
They shared
the horror
in silence
It must have been some sort of crayfish he said.
He had
?But
too
some
He had seen it
too - people kissing - & so, [strike]letting[/strike]
[strike]after[/strike] as the fish would not come out, & they both felt
awkward, & silent, & the waves seemed to Nancy sullener than ever,
more tremendous. And
[strike]she had[/strike] against the waves she had the
pitted the ferocity of man;
the lust & the warmth;
the ravening & the cruelty: nothing
beautiful remained [strike]of it[/strike] of it.
255
Raw & protruberent the domes & pinnacles of life pricked through the mist. And yet
the waves splashed in; only the force wh. had been in them, was now
divided against them; there was doom, & there was effort. She was on
the side of the sea
   [strike]But what with[/strike] It was not [strike]late[/strike] [strike]so late when they got up[/strike]
[strike]again on to the cliff;[/strike] but [strike]to[/strike] until they got up again onto the cliff
that Minta discovered ?how she had lost her grandmother's
brooch. - Her grandmother's brooch - the sole ornament she
weeping willow
possessed. [strike]It was[/strike] a pearl brooch, oblong, set round a landscape
always
& her grandmother had worn it to
fasten her little
lace cap.
And she had lost it. Tears streamed from
her
eyes.
desperate, [strike]serious,[/strike] determined,
They all went back. Paul Rayley searched where they had been
sitting.
All this tension
& seriousness about a pearl brooch,
did not do at all, Andrew thought, compelled to [strike]be[/strike]
search thoroughly
"between that point & this [strike]point[/strike]" as
always till the
day she died
She burst into
tears
She implored them
to find it;
& Yet it was
half pleasure,
Nancy felt; she
?liked losing that ?brooch
wh.
was [?] [?]
There was not
the least danger
of that,
Now it was
?useless ?trying
?long,
& always
had found
things,
Paul Rayley said making a [strike]serious[/strike] perfect pother about it;
was coming in
And the sea would be in, over the place where they had
sat, would cover the whole rock;
"We shall be cut off"
cried
terrified;
said Minta suddenly -
as if there were any danger of
that;
[strike]But as Andrew[/strike]
as Andrew thought. [strike]Then[/strike]
&
& decided
The men took counsel together,
(Andrew became excessively manly)
then
Paul's stick
they would plant a stick on
the spot; & come back at dawn.
[strike]So Minta was told[/strike],
M
& still she
wept for the loss of her brooch &
wept, [strike]Nancy[/strike] & for some other loss [strike]she wept[/strike]; as Nancy felt; - &
Paul comforted her; saying that he would be [strike]up at dawn,[/strike]
[strike]would[/strike] tell the police about it, & be up at dawn, & this so
[strike]comfo[/strike] by degrees cheered Minta, & [strike]certainly[/strike] it
some
cheered Paul,
[strike]who[/strike] & slowly he began fingering [strike]those[/strike]
astonishing possessions -
life, & being loved, & telling people
about it.
& its being declared to the world; &
all he would do for her; &
being married; &
then children, & everything everything
always together - [strike]so he went on,[/strike] until he
had
no
257
notion what was happening to them exactly, or that the world could
contain such feelings as his.
To be believed in - & to be ?made ?one of:
[strike]to fin[/strike] he vowed he would be up at three & find her brooch, &

put it on her plate; & take the boat to Edinburgh & buy
another; [strike]or[/strike] [strike]somehow[/strike] prove to her what he could do for her.
[strike]And there[/strike] And this mingled with the [strike]sudden[/strike] sprinkled lights
coming out on the edge of the bay; bright, [strike]clear[/strike]
[strike]sparkling,[/strike] [strike]rippling[/strike] with
divine laughter
& constant joy -
light
this mingled with that, & again he thought, as the
?some
of the town on
the sea.
with [strike]great[/strike] high
[strike]?bushe[/strike] hedges
walking on & on
[strike]& on[/strike]
alone along the
road
they came out on the road [strike]of the[/strike] where it was lonely &
brown-shaded, how awful the retreat was into themselves,
into solitude, & bare existence together, [strike]man[/strike] two
human beings alone; [strike]passing[/strike] walking along this road.
But he would protect her; he would be up at dawn &
?would
find her brooch; & the one person
he [strike]would[/strike] tell was Mrs.
Ramsay. Yes,
Mrs. Ramsay. [strike]He would go straight[/strike] to her.
[strike][?][/strike] telling her was his
reward, for it had been positively
awful - asking Minta to marry him: far the worst
[strike]thing he had ever[/strike] done in his life: it was far worse than
but
any examination: &
he had won. [strike]And[/strike]
[strike]?he would tell[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay.
Tears rose in his eyes. He knew why
Minta had not been
crying for her
brooch ?if he
knew.
Minta had cried. [strike]It is[/strike] half pain, he noted; this
[strike]extreme[/strike] happiness is the most serious
thing in the whole
?but happy in
It was all
world
Was it not through
Mrs. Ramsay who [strike]was the[/strike]
[strike]It is[/strike]
had come to him?
[strike]She had[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay who [strike]was the[/strike]
had taught him how feelings - how one may have feelings - She
[strike]had them[/strike] these queer feelings - She had them, he knew; &
her eyes
He had felt her eyes on
him all day long:
[strike]she was the[/strike]
presiding saint
One had saints.
[strike]But[/strike] Could one tell her
an
odious
what she had done for him
- [strike]a stubborn[/strike]
little [strike]ass[/strike], [strike]of n[/strike]
man
[strike]thinking no end of himself,[/strike]
& no one caring a straw for him,
until she took him up -
All that was good in
both of them they owed -
Minta owed it too. And

following him;
resting on him -
he cd. ?himself
259
so they reached the lane up to Finlay: [strike]It was awfully late, probably.[/strike]
[strike]One could tell that by the lights in the bedroom windows.[/strike]
& it must be late, with the lights in the windows.
Burn, he said;
blaze; make a hole in the the night, [strike]brave lights;[/strike] & they were
eyes
her eyes, [strike]only[/strike] & her childrens,
[strike]burning on in all their chambers[/strike]; &
which seemed to him [strike]to[/strike] burning there, blazing there. But
goodness knew, he
didn't want to make
a fool of himself.

March 5th
[u]XIV[/u]
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
   Well, then, [strike]she supposed,[/strike] Nancy had gone with them; Mrs. Ramsay
supposed, wondering, as she [strike]surv[/strike] [strike]considered[/strike] [strike]which[/strike] put down a
brush, took up a comb, & said 'Come in' to [strike]the little[/strike]
a tap at the door, (Timothy & Rose came in) whether the fact that
Nancy was with them made it less likely that anything would
less
happen: anyhow it was
[strike]not[/strike] likely that four people
would be drowned [strike]at once[/strike]
than
   three
   Timothy & Rose said
Mildred wanted to know whether she
should wait dinner.
   "Not for the Queen of England" said Mrs. Ramsay
emphatically.
   "Not for the Emperor of Mexico" she added.
And if Timothy liked, while Rose took the message, he might
choose which jewel she was to wear; for after all, where
there are fifteen people sitting
down to dinner, it is [strike]quite[/strike]
out of the question waiting - keeping
things hot is tiresome
enough. And it seemed to Mrs. Ramsay,
now that she was active,
that these people were only inconsiderate,
not tragic,
thinking
it did not matter
how late they
were,
[strike]nothing mattered,[/strike] though, in fact,
she particularly wished dinner to
be
nice, with [strike]Mr.[/strike] William Bankes dining with them; & to
show him she did know how to cook vegetables, she was
[strike]having one course entirely[/strike] having [strike]special[/strike] vegetables specially
[strike]a[/strike] too
?a ?la
done for him, &
Boeuf [strike]a la[/strike] au Daube, which had been
been weighing on
Mildred's spirits all day.
You
stand it in water for twenty four
hours: you [strike]add[/strike] stir
continuously; you add a little
bay leaf, & then a
dash of sherry:
the whole [strike]being[/strike]
never [strike]been[/strike] being
allowed,
of course, to come to the boil.
[strike]If they kept[/strike]
[strike]dinner waiting[/strike]
[strike]after all that, it would be most unfair upon[/strike]
[strike]Mildred.[/strike]
And then, tonight of all nights, they
263
late.
offered
an opal
Timothy [strike]would have liked[/strike] her to wear a gold necklace: Rose

an
gold
[strike]wanted her opal[/strike]
necklace;
Which did look best against her black
dress?
Which did indeed, said Mrs. Ramsay absent mindedly,
allowing her children to rummage among her things, while she
looked at a sight which always amused
her, the rooks
to decide
trying which tree to
settle on;
Everytime they changed their minds,
& rose into the air again,
[strike]whether[/strike]
because, she thought, the old
[strike]troubl[/strike]
rook, the old father rook, was
of [strike]an unsettled disposition.[/strike]
troublesome.
   Look, she said laughing.
Weren't the old birds actually
fighting?
[strike]quarelling?[/strike] Anyhow up they
all went again; & the air
was
cut into exquisite scimitar shapes;
the movement of the wings [strike]was[/strike]
beating out, out, out, was one
of the [strike]sights[/strike] loveliest of all
sights[strike][/strike][strike]: she[/strike] to her, in the pale sky
   But which was it to be? They had all the
trays of her old jewel case
open; the gold, which was Italian:
the opal, which Uncle
James gave her; or should she wear her
[strike]old[/strike] amythysts?
She let the children choose; she let Rose
try this that & the other, Rose who
was so horribly bad at her
sums, Mrs. Ramsay said; but
this little ceremony of choosing
jewels was, Mrs. Ramsay
half suspected [strike]only[/strike] perhaps not even
half, for there were[strike],[/strike]
in
her relations
with her children,
always hidden pockets
of emotion, [strike]which[/strike]
which she never examined,
a consolation
to Rose;
this choosing jewels was [strike]rather a serious[/strike] to [strike]poor[/strike] that
[strike]woolgathering[/strike]
[strike]dear[/strike]
[strike]tri[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]scatterbrained, silent child,[/strike]
[strike]who[/strike]
[strike]wished, passionately[/strike]
[strike]that her mother shd. wear the gold necklace, that she should[/strike]
[strike]fasten it, & should thus have one[/strike]
[strike]She loved the colours, seeing how things went, you 'white[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]The[/strike]
[strike]a ceremony[/strike]
to Rose; something she liked for
standing
to let her
but
were
hidden reasons,
what reasons, Mrs. Ramsay wondered,
[strike]thinking[/strike]
change the
necklace,
sadly of [strike]her[/strike] all the things one could not know. [strike]Was she[/strike]
divining, through her own past
[strike]the[/strike] some deep, some
but
not
buried, some
?anguished love, & [strike]not[/strike]
thinking
of it as love for -

herself; nor was it perhaps,
love of herself
[strike]but[/strike] [strike]for to Rose[?][/strike] [strike]but[/strike] for
but a love, so
natural as
?must ?not
?question
it;
265
was rather love of a voice, love of a face, love of a principle, almost, of
motherhood holding its children maternally, & womanhood, in its
valiancy, & [strike]the[/strike] [strike]of the[/strike] desire, passionate beyond telling,
a glan&lt;ce&gt;
to attract [strike]to he[/strike] [strike]one[/strike]
herself [strike]one[/strike] glance, one caress,
or the [strike]tenderness[/strike]
approval [strike]& underst[/strike] of eyes which suddenly, in the strangest way,
could bestow upon Rose heavenly bliss.
[strike]During[/strike]
Now
267
[strike]IX[/strike]
[u]XV[/u]
   "[strike]But[/strike] What have I done with my life?"
thought
[strike]said[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay
taking her place at the head of the long table. "William
sit by me," she said. Lily there..."
[strike]For some reason she[/strike]
[strike]could not[/strike]
[strike]They had[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] [strike]For it was all over.[/strike]
They had
an
that
their moment.
?She this: infinitely long, narrow,
white table; with
& a heap of
empty places; plates:
At the far end was her
husband. [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]who might say nothing from start to finish.[/strike]
[strike][?][/strike] sitting down
with a
shake of the head, a
sigh.
She had felt a great deal of emotion: she now felt

none whatever; nothing but [strike]that[/strike]
a
curious sense of being
she was
They had
borne on, because things were stronger
than oneself:
'that'; [strike]lost[/strike] [strike]what w[/strike] 'that' which
finally landed one in long tables, &
piles of plates.
[strike]A most curious sensation; to be[/strike] & that
would change presumably to this.
And for a moment
she had a curious sense of being
past everything, through everything;
out of everything; as they handed the soupplates; so that,
[strike]having the[/strike] being [strike]relieved of her burden,[/strike] [strike]she could say,[/strike] [strike]Well[/strike]
[strike]then what have I done with my life?[/strike]
[strike]But of course,[/strike]
what have I done, she would ask;
[strike]for as it was[/strike]
[strike]certain that she had[/strike]
& wait (while they came in, one after another, Charles Tansley,
Mr. Carmichael, [strike][?][/strike]) wait, passively, for somebody or other to
or for
[strike]give her[/strike] an answer; [strike]for[/strike] something
[strike]or other[/strike] to happen.
[strike]Only[/strike]
But [strike]this was not being sad.[/strike] And [strike]if they knew what[/strike]
But this is not a thing, she thought, ladling out another plate
for someone, [strike]to tell[/strike] that one says;
   [strike]Lily, she thought to herself would have been an admirable old[/strike]
[strike]maid.[/strike]
[strike]One does not say it to Lily, she thought.[/strike]
And smiling
ironically at [strike]her own[/strike] the discrepancy -
that was what she
ladling out
was thinking & this was what she was doing -
helping
soup:
she felt begin in her, like a [strike]stream or a [?][/strike] like the pulse of some
machine which stopped for a moment begins inexplicably to
work, the old familiar life again: & [strike]soo[/strike] so on; she thought,
269
remembering how long people lived & how they enjoyed it, & so on; &
so on, she repeated, ironically, cautiously sheltering this still feeble pulse,
which she must encourage, for form's sake; or how should she get
through dinner.
[strike]The truth of it is of course, she thought,[/strike]
And so on
she said, very nearly aloud this time, addressing herself to William Bankes,
who had been through it all;
Dear William Bankes: poor William
Bankes, for after all it must
be better dining up here than alone in
lodgings!
And at that moment,
cautiously in her pity for him, &
a [strike]new[/strike] life began; & she
noticed it, not without weariness,
though
anything else would have been
intolerable;
noticed it, as
the sailor see his
sail fill out; & [strike]we[/strike] knows himself off now:
& with this wind in her
sails, Mrs. Ramsay too
[strike]in one second would be off[/strike] was off -
And yet the strangeness remained;
271
like an ?outcast; [strike]like the[/strike] as if a shade had fallen, & robbed of colour
she saw things truly; & then, not of her own willing, but
independently
like the pulse of a machine, which, inexplicably stopped, inexplicably
begins again, the old
familiar life began [strike]beating.[/strike] And so on
& so on, she thought, mechanically,
[strike]as if she too[/strike]
thinking how
one, two,
three,
irrationally.
long peoples lives are & how much on the whole
they seem to
enjoy them).
And so on & so on, she repeated,
cautiously
fostering
sheltering & furthering the still feeble pulse,
[strike]so[/strike] as one
might guard a weak flame with a newspaper [strike])[/strike]
And so on,
she concluded, [strike]finding her life in her now almost[/strike] strong enough.
addressing herself, by bending slightly in his direction, to
who
William Bankes, - poor man!
[strike]He[/strike] had no wife, no children,
to bear her on again
[strike]&[/strike] in pity for him, life being now
strongly enough established,
she [strike]said[/strike] began again, all this
[strike]being[/strike] business,
[strike]as a sailor[/strike]
sees [strike]the wind[/strike]
not without weariness,
as a sailor see the
wind fill his sail, &
yet hardly wants to be off again;
how the ?boat
thinks
[strike]for a moment how the boat[/strike]
had it sunk, [strike]might have[/strike]
[strike]the boat[/strike] might have [strike]plunged[/strike] him to the depths of the sea.
[strike]taken[/strike]
whirled him
down & down
[strike]w[/strike] to the
depths
of the
sea.
[strike]"Well,[/strike] [strike]she said; to William,[/strike] Did [strike]they[/strike] you find your
she said
letters.
I told them to put them in the hall for you."
   Lily Briscoe noticed it - her ?drifting/?dipping into that [strike]odd[/strike]
strange no man's land, where following
is
impossible, [strike]& only[/strike]
[strike]some[/strike]
& [strike]one resents the[/strike] &
[strike]as some[/strike] & yet
to let them [strike]go &[/strike]
leave us is
intolerable; [strike]so[/strike]
so that Lily thought, seeing
how old
she
Mrs. Ramsay ladling out soup,
[strike]that she looked[/strike]
[strike]older than[/strike]
[strike]she should look,[/strike] [strike][/strike][strike]& then, for[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]more[/strike]
how old she
(resenting it)
looked; how worn she looked;
how stern; & then,
when she
turned to William Bankes,
Lily thought, with [strike]some[/strike]
amusement, why does she pity him?
For that was
the impression she gave, when she told him about his
letters; [strike]that[/strike]
Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be saying.
273
as if her own weariness which was so visible came from pity; & the
life in her were stirred by pity. And it was not true, Lily thought.
[strike]But then[/strike] Mr. Bankes was perfectly happy she was sure. He
had his work.
[strike]But then[/strike] Lily felt [strike]every[/strike] [strike]that everyone was[/strike]
very sure:
Lily felt, [strike]The wonderful[/strike]
[strike]thing about life is this:[/strike]
may
[strike]how[/strike] one [strike]thinks its like this: when, as a matter of fact,[/strike]
[strike]it is not like this:[/strike] I [strike]now know where[/strike] I shall put the [strike]light there[/strike]
tree rather further [strike]over; & so[/strike] to the middle: Then I shall
avoid that break, which is [strike]I'm sure now,[/strike] what was puzzling me [?] ?sure
She would do that first thing next morning. And
never
   [strike]How seldom[/strike] one gets anything by the post [strike]that is[/strike]
really worth having [strike]said Mr. Bankes.[/strike]
[strike]Yet[/strike] Yet one always
wants [strike]lett[/strike] one's letters, said Mr. Bankes.
that is
[strike]He[/strike]
[strike]Wat[/strike]
   [strike]But[/strike] What rot they talked, what rot,
thought Charles Tansley [strike]who had[/strike] laying down his spoon
cleaned
in the middle of his plate precisely, having [strike]eaten[/strike] [strike]swept[/strike] it
perfectly [?] bare.
was
determined to
make
as if, Lily thought, (he was precisely
opposite her) he [strike]was made[/strike] sure of his meals; [strike]as if[/strike] he
of any sort
had not an ounce of generosity over.
There he would sit,
in his pepper & salt coat & grey flannel trousers, eating his
all
& [?]
all
which
way through the meal like a cockchafer;
bristly, [strike]?packing[/strike]
now;
And Mrs. Ramsay would pity him: she pitied men, always;
never women.
[strike]Still[/strike]
Poor Charles Tansley - that was
precisely what Mrs. Ramsay was thinking. [strike]Poor litt little man[/strike]
[strike]For[/strike] He was not a gentleman:
[strike]No.[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley was[/strike]
[strike]thinking how he could never ?say ?thing about like that[/strike]
No.
He had
[strike]no conv[/strike]
nothing to say.
[strike]He was uneasy.[/strike]
What could she say
to make him feel easy?
Did you notice the lovely
light
But
[strike]Well,[/strike] he would not be made easy;
[strike]he would not talk[/strike]
[strike]nonsense,[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley thought.[/strike]
He would not talk nonsense.
For having finished the second volume of
Sorel's history of the
French Revolution, & sandwiched in a chapter of Meredith,
(this was more than he had bargained for, too)
Charles
in the ?world
Tansley
was rather up in
his
own estimation;
had
that
not?envious [strike]of[/strike]
lacking small talk was
any drawback.

come down stairs on the stroke of eight, & [strike]from that[/strike] here they were,
two silly women making men talk rot. He despised women;
not in the foolish way of a boy; but as men despise them.
[strike]He[/strike] If it were not for women, the world would have been civilised
centuries ago.
In every age they are the great hindrance to
proper
free thought, & [strike]responsible[/strike] life.
[strike]Some[/strike] ages have idealised them.
Now vaunting themselves the equals of men they will now
But
have to face frank criticism.
[strike]Unfortunately,[/strike] with minds of
wax, they will never face anything.
There [strike]was[/strike] [strike]little[/strike] no
is
chance of going to the lighthouse, [strike]he was afraid,[/strike] Charles
turning in his chair
Tansley said.
[strike]Were the[/strike] Why, then,
did one mind
what he
said, Lily Briscoe
wondered.
[strike]for[/strike]
[strike]being so[/strike] insignificant as he was!
O its Shakespeare, she corrected herself - as a forgetful ?person,
entering [strike]Hyde Park,[/strike] Regents Park, [strike]might wonder why[/strike] & seeing
the Park keeper was coming towards her menacingly;
[strike]they make on[/strike] [strike]dogs must be on a lead;[/strike]
might exclaim
of course
Oh I remember dogs must be on a lead!
So Lily Briscoe
remembered that [strike]everyon[/strike] [strike]man[/strike] has Shakespeare [strike]behind him;[/strike]
women have not.
&
[strike]We are not so nearly so clever as[/strike]
how men
have that
behind them;
& women
nothing.
[strike]they are, she thought, & therefore I must[/strike]
What then could she
say? [strike]to[/strike] inferior as she was; &
was it not much easier to be
inferior after all? -
That is the whole secret of art, she
not for oneself
thought to herself.
To care for the thing: what does it matter
& did she mind
being inferior,
did she feel, on
the whole
inferior? -
whether I succeed or not?
And joyous as she was tonight,
about her picture, she [strike]abased h[/strike] was very very nice, to
Charles Tansley. She was[strike],[/strike] a charming creature, [strike]Lily;[/strike]
her Lily; Mrs. Ramsay thought
Without any
striking charm, without any of the glow that made one
notice Minta directly she came [strike]into a room[/strike],
in
Lily had qualities that would
She could

wanted

But did one not always like people
when one looked at them?
grey blue
She must admit that his eyes were good: he had honest eyes.
   "Do you write many letters, Mr. Tansley?" said
Mrs. Ramsay pitying him too, Lily supposed; for that was true
of Mrs. Ramsay: she pitied men always as if they lacked
& never
never
something; [strike]nev[/strike] [strike]not[/strike] [strike]she did[/strike] not pity women, as if they had
something. Yet it was the other way round; women had nothing
power
men everything - [strike]considered[/strike]
for the material point of view,
office,
But
it was very like
[strike]everything[/strike] were
so much
easier
men
for
money, education; & so on.
[strike]men had all that instantly.[/strike]
[strike]It all[/strike],
it was part of
Mrs. Ramsay
   He wrote to his mother; but otherwise he did not write
to anybody, Mr. Tansley said
   For he was not going to talk the sort of rot these people
wanted him to talk. Having finished [strike]his ch vo[/strike] vol
two of Sorel before dinner, he had wedged in a chapter of
Harry Richmond & was not going to be condescended to by
these upper middle class women;
[strike][?][/strike]
whom he despised.
[strike]What[/strike]
[strike]did they know of anything?[/strike]
"One never gets anything worth having by
he ?should [?] in
worth having
the post" - that was true.
They never got anything from one
years end to another. They [strike]exist[/strike] live the most useless of lives;
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]His own mother did more[/strike]
[strike]They did not know the[/strike]
with
[strike]meaning of work.[/strike] talk, talk, talk; other women waiting on
them; & [strike]they despised[/strike]
It was women who made civilisation impossible.
He despised women more & more.
   "No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs.
Ramsay" he said, half turning in his chair, as if to
confirm his [strike]weath[/strike] forecast.
[strike]of the weather[/strike].
   He was really,
Lily Briscoe thought, the most
uncharming human being 
she had ever met.
[strike]And so[/strike]
Why, then,
did one mind
what he said?
Oh, she remembered,
Shakespeare - that is to say, she had momentarily forgotten in
[strike]in her own elation,[/strike] [strike]how wo[/strike] about women not being
creative, & men being creative; & Charles Tansley therefore
being quite within his rights when he [strike]told[/strike] maintained that
to talk down to her; to say what was the use of her ?painting?
279
They could not paint or write or do anything ever: so that, being a man,
one had to respect him. [strike]All[/strike] She had clean forgotten. Now, she said looking at him,
now
to herself; [strike]lets have[/strike] it over;
meaning that [strike]now[/strike] she would now
descend to the [strike]caves[/strike] bottom of despair & let the [strike]dark[/strike] waves of humility
break; [strike]&[/strike] Then [strike]she would[/strike] come up cringing.
Down she went;
horror & despair; annihilation; nonentity; sure enough, they arched
their backs &
crashed over her; [strike]stooping form,[/strike] & yet - & yet. Opening her eyes
in the pale world of daylight again, she was aware of some
[strike]profound[/strike] [strike]small[/strike] trophy retrieved [strike]down[/strike] there; some talisman she
would sew to the inside of her dress (how [strike]the[/strike] [strike]it is[/strike] things themselves

i[strike]ndeed ever lasting;[/strike] [strike]how how[/strike] nothing else

[strike]she[/strike] was so [strike]joyous[/strike]
in her freedom
& did not the position of the
salt cellar mark something

He should have married a working class woman - for it irked him;
here he was staying with them; & he had no change of clothes for
the evening. He [strike]?to[/strike] did not know the sort of things they talked about -
like this "one never gets anything worth having by the post."

what Lily
Briscoe felt:

Mr. Tansley.

dissertations, & it was all very well for her, with two hundred a

But for
A strong young man - here she was again, [strike]just[/strike] saying
things she did not believe
in the least: but she did mean to

   "Yes. Take it away" said Mrs. Ramsay, briefly.
[strike]For[/strike]
It must have been twenty years ago [strike]that[/strike] or almost, that
she had stayed with
the Careys;

everything was still

Oh she could remember it
as if it were yesterday.
She could remember a picnic on a
bank. It was one of those chilly April days when most people
prefer to stay in doors. The Careys, however, once they made a
plan, stuck to it.
[strike]There was[/strike] It was very very cold. [strike]Hebe[/strike]

   [strike]After all, Mr. Bankes said,[/strike]

How strange - they were alive.
For Mrs. Ramsay [strike]con[/strike] found it
very difficult to think that the Careys would have been living all
this time, without her thinking of them. How full, how eventful,
her own life had been,
these last [strike]twenty years[/strike], fifteen years:

[strike]It seemed to her quite impossible that[/strike] Mrs. Carey [strike]had[/strike]

   "People soon drop out" said William Bankes humorously;
guessing Mrs. Ramsays thought. He [strike]did a[/strike] could not help
feeling a little gratified. Here was he, knowing them both;
he stayed with the Ramsays:
he stayed with the Careys.
That seemed to show that he moved in more circles than one.
[strike]That seemed to show that he had kept[/strike]

He was a little
amused; & gratified too; for did he not know
the
Ramsays & the Careys?
[strike]He knew them both.[/strike]

it not seem to give him a superiority - &, he reflected,
&
made a point
[strike]D[/strike] [strike]He[/strike] [strike]wa[/strike] moved in more circles than one, he thought,
approvingly; [strike]laying down his spoon. He[/strike] [strike][?[/strike]] [strike]h[/strike] [strike]y[/strike]
nobody could say that he had got into groove; & thus

He was not going to talk the rot these people wanted him to talk.

Tansley asked himself, turning in

amused that Mrs. Ramsay should be so astonished at Mrs. Careys
continued existence, gratified that he was the link between them.
[strike]He knew[/strike] them both; he had not drifted apart, he thought,
laying down his spoon & wiping his clean shaved lips punctiliously,
But perhaps he was rather unusual [strike]in this[/strike] he thought,
in this, that he never let himself get into a groove.
He [strike]never[/strike] had friends in all circles -
[strike]But[/strike] the [strike]nat[/strike]
reason why he preferred dining alone was to avoid the kind of
wait whic was [strike]inevitable[/strike]
unavoidable in a [strike]family[/strike] party

They kept one waiting while they changed the plates.
Mrs. Ramsay had to break off & tell the maid something.

[strike]For say what one will, work is the great pleasure[/strike]
[strike]in life: the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]great excitement: The poets talk of life being short. work is[/strike]
[strike]the great excitement;[/strike] Indeed,
all these things waste time.
Well, thought Mr. Bankes, preserving
a demeanuor of [strike]the[/strike]
exquisite courtesy, & merely spreading
the fingers of his left
hand on the tablecloth, as a mechanic
examines a
tool which is beautifully polished &

?After
[strike]He spent[/strike] 20 minutes over dinner, [strike]at home.[/strike] Then he was free to
[strike]work.[/strike] had he been alone, he would then have been free to work.
Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time. [Why, some of the
children are not down yet - [strike]Nor could they they begin again[/strike]

"I wish one of you would run up to
Roger's room" Mrs. Ramsay was saying - ] [strike]only[/strike] & [strike]yet[/strike]
he
respected & admired the Ramsays, & yet, he thought, even so,
[strike]how pale this is,[/strike] how trifling this is - [strike]as a[/strike] how boring this is -
for had he been free, he would have [strike]done nothing but[/strike] read - [strike]But[/strike]
[strike]how could he think of his work now? - with sitting beside[/strike]
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay? All[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]He admired them; he was very[/strike][strike][/strike]
by way of being an [strike]old[/strike] friend, all that: but
Mrs. Ramsay was thinking of something else.
And in the
shade of her presence, which prevented
him of course from fixing
his mind upon any regrets of his
own, he [strike]thought[/strike] [strike]with[/strike]
compared the excitement & the
pleasure & the sense of being
part of eternity (for ?in working
time seemed to have no
existence) [strike]& he[/strike]
which he would have had, had he been alone,
he compared that intensity that
excitement
which he had
putting
away
foregone, with this - this miserable
suspension of all
activity; [strike]this[/strike] [strike]& then[/strike] this sitting about drumming ones
fingers on the table. This cynicism - yes, for what [strike]did[/strike]
do human relationships amount to then?
There are
the [strike]Careys & the Ramsays.[/strike]
I am by way of being
[strike]a great[/strike] devoted to her, he thought. Yet Mrs.
Ramsay meant nothing to him, nothing, he thought,
stari&lt;ng&gt;
[strike]glaring[/strike]
[strike]from his blue eyes[/strike]
[strike]so hopelessly[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] blankly:
293
[strike]& yet she was only two feet away from him.[/strike]
   [strike]Indeed it was his conviction that[/strike]
   The [strike]passion[/strike] [strike]Preserved as he was by[/strike] He seldom thought about [strike]the[/strike]
such things: he was not a poet, not a novelist; his interest in life was
purely scientific. Just every now & then - if he was put out by
something - he asked himself questions like this: What should we say
if we were honest? Is human life a good thing, or ?it is it a bad
thing?
Why do we desire the continuance of the human race
upon earth?
What do we live for?
Such questions never
occurred to him at other times.
He was

   "I [strike]must[/strike] am so sorry" said Mrs. Ramsay; who had
been giving instructions of some sort.
For

Yet
She is one of my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to her
But
he thought. [strike]And yet[/strike]
her presence meant nothing to him: her beauty
by himself
meant nothing to him:
he wished only to be alone; & so
relieved from the disagreeable
necessity of realising
that he
had no feeling whatever for his friends:
His work was what he
to be alone &
able to work:
wanted. [strike]In default of[/strike] Work [strike]being impossible,[/strike] [strike]?there[/strike] But he must
sit here, drumming his fingers on the table, & feeling
uncomfortable because of his treachery - that
he was not
that he felt nothing for his
[strike]that it was all[/strike]
friends
enjoying himself, able to feel anything:
[strike]tasteless & insipid;[/strike]
He did not enjoy family life.
And
it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself [strike]those[/strike]
[strike]such questions as[/strike] - What do we live for? Why do we
desire the continuance of the human race? - questions
one asked
oneself,
which never occurred [strike]normally;[/strike] [strike]but were[/strike] [strike]One never thought[/strike]
[strike]about it,[/strike] if one was occupied. But [strike]sometimes[/strike] one could
not escape that sort of thing; especially when, as now,

to one; [strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay had forgotten Mrs.
Carey; [strike]that[/strike] he [strike]?himself felt nothing for Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] -
[strike]sitting though he was a few inches from her, &[/strike]
sat a few inches off Mrs. Ramsay, & was indifferent to her.
   "I am so sorry" said Mrs. Ramsay who had giving
been
instructions
of some sort.

which had been soaked

[strike]that would[/strike] be [strike]very[/strike]
painful, very painful.
   How you must regret
dining in this bear
garden said Mrs. Ramsay:
297
when
she had a social manner [strike]sometimes[/strike], she was a little distracted.
as, [strike]in[/strike] when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting, the chairman,
in order to [strike]unify the[/strike] obtain unity, [strike]drops into[/strike] [strike]French.[/strike]
suggests that everyone shall speak French. Perhaps it is bad French;
French may not contain the words necessary for the speaker's
thoughts; [strike]nevertheless,[/strike] but speaking French [strike]nevertheless[/strike]
imposes some order, some uniformity.
Replying to her in
the same language, Mr. Bankes said [strike]that[/strike]
"Not at all. [strike]Not at all[/strike]"

Mr. Tansley had no

Are you a

   [strike]So Lily in her[/strike] Indeed [strike][?][/strike] he was: but in his desire to make out

And that would lead to
his grandfather being a fisherman; to his
being self taught; to his
being the first of his family to obtain a university education;
to his being glad of it;
to his being Charles Tansley in
short - [strike]who was not even realised in this room &[/strike]
which nobody in this room seemed to realise. [strike]And yet[/strike] [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]he felt[/strike] Everybody here [strike]will be glad to say[/strike] that they know me
in ten years time, he thought, & felt almost pity; for
as a grain of dynamite laid beneath [?] bales of wool

ignorance [strike]of[/strike]

For he would blow them all

said all [strike]do[/strike] this, as her tone said it, of course, for the fiftieth time, Lily
Briscoe had to renounce that experiment - [strike]of[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] what happens if

   Lily Briscoe thought, feeling Mrs. Ramsays relief, But what
haven't I paid to get ?it ?you?

been lost.
And [strike]she thought[/strike] her eye
caught the salt cellar &
she remembered with a shock of exquisite relief how [strike]that[/strike]

"But how long do they leave [strike]a man[/strike] alone on a lighthouse?" she
asked.
   Mrs. Ramsay wished to talk about the Careys again;
to enter that dreamland, that unreal land, where the trees stood
stock still, & there was no haste -

a sort of humour
a pity
from knowing

She wished to talk of all
that; [strike]but that[/strike]

[strike]Like so many other things;[/strike]
[strike]but it was[/strike]
[strike]twitched away.[/strike]
[strike]She knew it.[/strike]
but [strike]no: it[/strike] had floated from her.
[strike]The mood had gone.[/strike]
[strike]Mr.[/strike] William Bankes was not in the mood
[strike][/strike][strike]But then he should be in the mood. But what was[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]it that she did?[/strike]

   "The children are [strike]quite[/strike] disgraceful" she said.

He replied something
about punctuality being one
of the [strike]vir[/strike] minor virtues which we
do not acquire until later in life.
   [strike]Mrs. Ramsay knew quite well, & Mr. Bankes knew quite well[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]that here was a horrid affair: that they were at loggerheads.[/strike]
   "If at all" said Mrs. Ramsay, merely to fill up space.

And conscious
of his treachery, conscious of her desire for
thing else from
these
some [strike]more[/strike] [strike]intimate talk,[/strike]
This perfunctory
words
if at all,
feel
?profoundly,
that he
[strike]seemed[/strike] [strike]seemed vain[/strike] & made Mr. Bankes [strike]a[/strike]
pity her; &
[strike]then[/strike] But what was he to do?
What were they to say?
What were other people saying?
[strike]W[/strike] Surely one
305
catch some line thrown from the other [strike]end of the table?[/strike] Lily &
Mr. Tansley were talking about the fishing industry; [strike]They were[/strike]
& [strike]emigration.[/strike]
[strike]They were[/strike]
&
talking about emigration.
[strike]All that,[/strike]
& that was all so admirable - that [strike]the[/strike] facts should be
discussed & injustice exposed;
that the failure of some
[strike][?][/strike] men to [strike]bring in[/strike] make enough to live
on this year should be
deplored, & the pressure
which drove them to America
should be denounced; but honestly, what was lacking? [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]Why[/strike] [strike]Some[/strike] [strike]The usual thing.[/strike]
Already bored, Lily Bankes
knew that something was lacking; William Bankes catching on to
Tansleys last words "one of the most scandalous acts of the
present government" knew that something was lacking.
[strike]And[/strike]
The usual
Only [strike]this: that no[/strike]
[strike]Some[/strike] profound unreality had
mixed itself in; & bending themselves to listen to the
tale of suffering & injustice,
what they felt was, pray
not be seen
Heaven that the inside of my mind may
never be exposed to view
for I am [strike]fo[/strike] lying.

their pity,

hoping that they
were separate)
[strike]attent[/strike] time, attention; but who of all those
Always they had
all felt this: when
it came to
the suffering of the poor: to the
vast waves that desolate whole countrysides - to eruptions
of earthquakes; to the tyranny & injustice (how naturally
the words ran into absurd rhetorical couples which one
would be ashamed to feel on one's own lips!)
then,
secretly, they had all felt [strike]this[/strike] the same discomfort &
at

[strike]depression,[/strike] their
own unworthiness, of their own
cynicism; & giving their names or time or money to the
cause or the fund, each
had come away with the same
dissatisfaction
[strike]sense of profound unreality.[/strike]
[strike]feeling:[/strike] [strike]conscio[/strike]
they had been
deceived
   But, perhaps, thought Mr. Bankes, as he
this
looked at Mr.
Tansley, he is the man.
[strike]He gav[/strike]
There was always the chance
it
them always the
benefit of the doubt.
At any moment the
307
leader
sincere man may arise: the man of genius, the great man. [strike]Moreover,[/strike]
Probably he will be
excessively disagreeable to us old fogies, thought
Mr. Bankes. Unkempt, ill-mannered all of that. [strike]And[/strike]
[strike]But after he had listened to Tansley talking, again the unreality[/strike]
But - here Mr. Bankes came to the usuall conclusion; Mr.
what he did not know
not
Tansley could tell him [strike]nothing[/strike]
[strike]that he did not[/strike] know already.
He [strike]w[/strike] abused the Government. Perfectly justly no doubt. But
Mr. Bankes himself could abuse the government. [strike]In all the[/strike]
It is not abuse that is wanted, Mr. Bankes felt; thinking of his
plants, & their nervous systems & respiratory organs:
In sciences,
there is creation; in art, creation; but in this
art, some say the
highest, there is nothing but abuse,
[strike]nothing but ?some high flown[/strike]
words, that mean nothing: intrigue;
(he will do well in Parliament
very likely, he thought) & when we ordinary people, who are
quite ready to do what we can to help, come & [strike]say tell us,[/strike]
tell us what to do, make us believe you;
[strike]we get[/strike] a handful of sand
thrown in our eyes.
Yet one must be scrupulously careful,
For Mr.
Tansley was
describing his ?own
success on a
tour.
Mr. Bankes corrected himself; [strike]for[/strike] It is undoubtedly to our
[strike]not[/strike]
interest [strike]to[/strike] that [strike]no[/strike] [strike]reformer should arise.[/strike]
[strike]things should remain as[/strike]
they are.
   Such thoughts [strike]were[/strike] could lead only in one direction: the
decay of religious belief.
And if at Mr. Ramsay's table
one began thinking of the
decay of religious belief, one looked,
naturally, at Mr. Ramsay.
   [strike]It is[/strike] "They are so much worse off" Mrs. Ramsay
[strike]?no[/strike] began, [strike]but[/strike] [strike]so much[/strike] under the influence of Mr.
Tansley's style that instead of thinking of Betty McNab
& Ellie Kennedy she thought of 'them', the poor,
who were [strike]w[/strike] 'happy' or miserable, in blocks;
but [strike]she could not stand[/strike] there were thing she could
not stand.
Certain hypocrisies, as they left her lips, stung her.
Here at last [strike]were[/strike] was the
309
He knew by some curious physical sensation, as of nerves erect, that
an  of some attack upon
he was jealous [strike]of[/strike] in [strike]some[/strike] obscure way; [strike]afra[/strike] anxious to
defend his own life work, his science; & therefore not entirely openminded
fair to this young man Tansley & his view; for Tansley seemed to
be saying [strike]to them all[/strike] How you have [strike]all[/strike] wasted your lives.
Tansley seemed to be rather a cocksure young man. But [strike]of course,[/strike]
Mr. Bankes allowed, he had courage on his side, & youth.
[strike]But[/strike]
It is,
[strike]However[/strike]
[strike]the immediate question was[/strike]
Mr. Bankes [strike]asked[/strike] observed to
that is
himself, [strike]what[/strike] the decay of religious
belief has been responsible
for much of this (that there is no St. Francis:
no [strike]gr[/strike] leader of social
reform) & if at Mr. Ramsays
table one began thinking of

the decay of religious belief, one looked, at least, at [strike]M.[/strike]
Mr. Ramsay.
   [strike]That the destruction[/strike] [strike]What indeed was he thinking?[/strike]
[strike]this[/strike] Not a combatant himself, Mr. Bankes had faith in
Ramsay, [strike]who[/strike] But at this moment, at this precise moment,
Mr. Ramsay's face expressed nothing but protest & even horror.
At what catastrophe? [strike]Poor[/strike] Mr. Carmichael had asked
for another plate of soup. Leaning back, he had
touched the maids arm,
& requested, that his plate should be
?din
returned to him, full.
And she had [strike]given him[/strike] his plate.
And he was now addressing
himself to his second helping
when one, according
to Mr. Ramsay, was
more than enough
for any human being;
when the process of drinking soup
was distressing:
when he slobbered it over his whiskers.
when of all things,
Mr. Ramsay detested hanging about
waiting
for people to finish.
This was in his face,
next
[strike]undisguised;[/strike]
& [strike]at any[/strike] moment [strike]he might say[/strike]
[strike]something:[/strike]
saying it
[?] eyes
though no
[strike]But[/strike] He was capable of it.
Like a pack of hounds his
words flew like smoke on
top of his emotions.
But -
Mrs. Ramsay had told him
[strike]of[/strike] that story about begging
eighteenpence to buy tobacco.
He should have his
soup in peace then:
he should gorge & guzzle to his hearts
content then; but nobody knew - so
311
[strike]Mr. Ramsay seemed to say, clasping his hands together, what anguish[/strike]
[strike]this restraint caused him; only his wife only his wife would[/strike]
[strike]give him credit for it.[/strike]
But if you clap the breaks onto a wheel
that is going full tilt - that ?was his sensation: for the
rapidity of his mind, & the acuteness of his sensations,
over trifles,
[strike]there[/strike] then sparks fly; & the whole of his body
was a shower of sparks; [strike]beautifully[/strike] perfectly, controlled, he
considered, looking at his wife to verify this statement,
[strike]He had not abused poor old[/strike]
[strike]Poor old Carmichael might[/strike]
[strike]have his soup,[/strike]
He remembered her story about
Carmichael begging eighteenpence to buy tobacco.
He
his soup for
wd.
[strike]could[/strike] not grudge him anything.
And [strike]sighing profoundly[/strike] Mr.
sharply
Ramsay enforced
his wifes demands that somebody
should
run up & pull
Andrew out of his bath; [strike]speaking[/strike] venting upon
his sons his tartness, his irritation, while consuming
soup
placidly, Mr. Carmichael sat [strike]in[/strike] there, unmoved,
benignant, to all appearances indifferent to this hubbub,
to that hubbub, wrapped in content.
   It might be true that he had asked his wife for
eighteen pence. [strike]She was certainly a most disagreeable lady.[/strike]
paid
a visit
It might be true that kind Mrs. Ramsay had [strike]visited[/strike] them
But
been up to
see them.
[strike]that sort of thing did not trouble him.[/strike] These sort of things made
little impression on him. [strike]He[/strike] In the vast & it must be
admitted bewildering hailstorm, among those variously
flying splinters of matter, things to do, thing not to do,
[strike]appointments to keep,[/strike] deciding this, deciding that, [strike]he had[/strike]

of the whole machine, so he would explain to his dear friend Andrew,
bearing nobody any malice, [strike]comp[/strike] never complaining of injustice,
& interested in his own case as in that of another;
among all these obstacles & impediments he had found only one
sure panacea to twiddle his ?long
thumbs before replying to a question

He translated Persian into English. [strike]What did[/strike] But here again he
[strike]waited[/strike] allowed the words to come
