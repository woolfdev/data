bought the wrong dress.
Prof. Brierly on Milton.

Somebody quite unknown.

The New Dress
& other stories:

This book will consist of the stories of
people at Mrs. D's party.
States of
mind.
Each separate from the other.
1. The new dress. 2. Happiness (the man
who looks at a speck of dust on his
trouser [ie?] 3. The picture - I think
of the sea - 4. Professor Brierly
My idea is that these sketches will
be a corridor [strike]from[/strike] leading from Mrs.

Dalloway to a new book. What I expect to
happen is that [strike]half[/strike] some two figures
will detach themselves from the party
& go off independently into another
volume; but I have no notion of this
at present.
The book of stories ought
to be complete in itself.
It must
have some unity, though I want to
publish each character separately.
One of the characters
is to be
a
pair of candlesticks, or a vase of
flowers. another the picture.
another a long conversation.
These could be done
this
summer.

The girl
who had written an essay on
the character of Bolingbroke
talking
to the young man
who
destroys a
fly as he speaks.
[u]The Past[/u]
founded on images ancestor worship,
what it amounts to, & means.
Some middle aged woman
of distinguished parents; her
feelings for her father & mother -

One about people looking out of a window & realising
the planets, or some quite other world.
being recalled to this one.

The New dress.

Happiness.

Ancestors.

The Introduction

The man who [strike]thinks that[/strike] wishes to

all this: has unaccountable feelings:
chiefly of discomfort;

one must be an exciting conversation
all, or almost all, in dialogue.

It strikes me that it might all end with a picture.
These stories about people would fill
half the book: & then the other thing would
loom up; & we should step into quite a
different place & people?
But what?

[u]To the Lighthouse[/u]
All character - [u]not[/u] a view of the world.
Two blocks joined by a corridor.

Topics that may come in:
How her beauty is to be conveyed by the
impression that she makes on all these
people.
One after another feeling it without
knowing exactly what she does to them,
to charge her words.
Episode of taking Tansley to call on the poor.
How they see her.
The great cleavages in to which the human
race is split, through
the Ramsays
not
liking Mr. Tansley.
But they liked Mr. Carmichael.
Her reverence for learning and painting.
Inhibited, not very personal.
The look of the room -
fiddle and sand shoes -
Great photographs covering bare patches.
12
The beauty is to be revealed the 2nd time
Mr. R stops
discourse on sentimentality.
He was quoting The Charge of the Light Brigade,
& then impressed upon it was this picture
of mother and child.

[strike]Ev[/strike] The source of all Evil.
She was lapsing into mere sensation -
seeing things in the garden. *
The waves breaking.
Tapping of cricket balls.
The bark "How's that?
They did not speak to each other.
Tansley shed
Tansley the product of universities
had to
assert the power of his intellect.

*She feels the glow of sensation - & how they are
made up of all these different things - (what
she has just done) & wishes for some bell to
strike & say this is it.
It does strike.
She guards her moment.
