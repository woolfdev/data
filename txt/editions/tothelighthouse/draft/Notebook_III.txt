run or hurry upstairs;
She felt, rather, inclined just for a
moment, [strike]to shed, as it[/strike] to stand still, after all that
one
chattering, & pick out [strike]whatever it was[/strike] some single thing:
the fact that Paul & Minta were engaged; to detach it,
separate it off; clean it of all the emotions & follies; & so
hold it before her; bring it to the tribunal where, ranged
about in conclave sat the judges she had set up in her to
decide these things. Is it good, bad, right wrong? Am I
justified? Where does this all tend? & so on, righting
herself after the shock of the event; & quite incongruously,
using the branches of the elm trees outside [strike]as[/strike]
to stabilise her position. ?All must be in order.
She must get that right, & that right, she thought, [strike]?as ?if[/strike]

It was windy, so that the
leaves now & then brushed [strike]open[/strike] a star,
[strike]& lit it[/strike] & the stars
themselves seemed to be shaking &
darting light & trying to flash out [strike]irregular[/strike] between the
with
edges of the leaves.
Yes, that was done then; & as [strike]over[/strike] all
[strike]people[/strike]
things done, now one thought of it, clear of chatter &
[strike]emotion[/strike],
it
[strike]one flicked it[/strike]
it seemed that it had always been, & was

They
would come back to this night then.
And it
pleased her to think how [strike]in the[/strike] all their lives long [strike]with[/strike]
in
their memories she would be woven, & this, & this, & this,

with a laughing affection, for

on the nursery door,

of partition became thin
[strike]as[/strike]
[strike]paper,[/strike] so that her own
death
would matter rather less,

since Paul & Minta [strike]inherited[/strike]
the things she had
so that
practically it
was all one

[strike]taking them in to the stream of their own lives,[/strike]
would sweep them on [strike]& on & on[/strike]
[strike]And[/strike] she [strike]open[/strike]
turned the door handle, [strike]&[/strike] firmly, [strike]so as to[/strike] lest it should
squeak, & went in, [strike]to the[/strike] pursing her lips slightly, as if
to prevent herself before she had spoken from speaking aloud.
But it was not needed.
She was annoyed.
There was
James wide awake, &
Mildred
[strike]in her[/strike] out of bed.

It was the skull again. She had told Mildred to move it, but
Mildred, of course, had forgotten; & now there was Cam wide awake
in her bed, ?& James wide awake in his, because Cam woke up
it
terrified by [strike]the shadows[/strike], & [strike]James of course[/strike] to James it was the
apple of his eye. [strike]Indeed[/strike] It was a horrid thing - a [strike]wil[/strike] boar's

[strike]wha[/strike] then of course this happened; [strike]they ?bitter quarrelled,[/strike]
[strike]So[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay said could they not take it down?
But [strike]it was[/strike] nailed to the wall, Mildred [strike]to[/strike] said.
Then
Cam must go to sleep & dream of lovely palaces, said Mrs.
Ramsay sitting down [strike]on her bed[/strike] by her side. [strike]No:[/strike]

And it was true. Wherever they put the nightlight (&
how could Mildred sleep without a light in the room? [strike])[/strike]
[strike]she was[/strike] afraid of beetles) [strike]one saw the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike]
[strike]shadow of the tusks, as Cam said.[/strike] there was always a
shadow somewhere.
[strike]Poor old pig, said Mrs. Ram[/strike]

Cam was terrified; Cam
hated shadows; Cam could
see the tusks whichever side she
lay.
[strike]She must shut her eyes & think of birds &[/strike]
[strike]flowers & beautiful butterflies.[/strike]
   Well, then, said Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]it must[/strike] we will
cover it up." & [strike]she[/strike] they all watched her, going to the
chest of drawers, & opening [strike]first the short drawer, &[/strike]
[strike]shutting[/strike] [strike]looking in, & shutting it, & then opening the[/strike]

skull, & [strike]making it sound & comfortable, & ?wra[/strike]
wrapping it round & round & round, & then she went back to Cam,
& laid her head down almost on the pillow, & said Oh how
lovely it looked - how the fairies would love it. It was like a great
bird's nest now. And it was, rather. Or it was like a great
mountain, [strike]with[/strike] such as Mrs. Ramsay had seen in
Switzerland, with beautiful villages, full of flowers, &
birds singing, & little [strike]girls with[/strike] girls, & little cottages with
Cam looked &
smoke going up &
[strike]What[/strike] her mother said was

that
true; it was like a mountain & a birds nest & a hanging
garden [strike]on the side of a cif cliff, & birds[/strike] & a cloud, &
And now James has got what he wanted, said Mrs. Ramsay
& she promised she
would go to sleep
& dream of
mountains,
gardens & beautiful
birds

is [strike]lovely;[/strike] & stream, &
crossing over to his bed, & he must go to sleep at once.
But he wanted to [strike]say[/strike] ask her something. [strike]It was[/strike]
She
suddenly remembered what it was going to be - it was
about the Lighthouse of course.
Did she think they would
go to the Lighthouse tomorrow? [strike]sh[/strike] he asked
?No not
She thought that they would not go tomorrow but she
thought [strike]that they would[/strike] go soon.
The very first
parrots, &
Mrs. Ramsay
repeated, slower -
slower, more &
more mechanically,
until Cam's
eyes shut,
fine day she said.
   Feeling for her shawl, & remembering that she had
wrapped it round the boars [strike]h[/strike] skull, she [strike]to[/strike] [strike]went,[/strike] got up, &
stopping a moment to see that they had both lain
down [strike]that[/strike] & [strike]shut[/strike] Mildred was in bed, she
once more coming to see
thought that the window was not wide enough open, -
so [strike]?crossed[/strike] & pulling it down another inch or two &
[strike]hearing the wave[/strike] so that she heard, more loudly, the
waves falling & got a [strike]little[/strike] breath of the [strike]sweet[/strike]
the cold untainted night air she[strike] left[/strike] murmured good
night & left the room, saying to herself, as she shut
into ?the ?lock
the door "that is good Charles running up to his
work" & she only hoped, as she let the tongue of the
door slowly lengthen itself, that, [strike]necess[/strike] he
would not
bump & bang above the nursery,

[strike]going downstairs again, necessary though it is that[/strike]
[strike]he should win his fellowship[/strike]
& waken the children, who were so easily woken, &

drop things on the floor she thought

little scene of ?C T

Charles Tansley - she instantly saw him [strike]in his[/strike] & thought that
he
had
[strike]she[/strike] [strike]had[/strike]
actually knocked over a pile of books which were
he had picked them up
?on his little writing table in the window; & [strike]undid his collar, yes,[/strike]
at his table
[strike]for[/strike] then sat down, [strike]rather grimly,[/strike] [[strike]?],[/strike] [strike]poor young[/strike] man; [strike]he[/strike]
poor young man to
work as usual
when
all the others were
enjoying
themselves
[strike]had not succeeded in impressing himself upon anybody at[/strike]
[strike]dinner, beside his candles, he & said to himself felt very[/strike]
[strike]lonely & really, if she could have thought of an excuse for going to[/strike]
[strike]him she would have done so. but[/strike] He looked
& she would have gone into him, but [strike]rem[/strike] reflecting, with one half of
her brain that [strike]this was her invention[/strike] - he had not knocked
that
all
over his books - [strike]she next[/strike] it was her invention - she
[strike]reproached herself for[/strike] thought herself silly for exaggerating as
usual, reflected that no power on earth could [strike]give[/strike]
after all help him to acquire those graces which were so
attractive in Paul Rayley, & heaven [strike]pro[/strike] had provided a
substitute in moral philosophy or John Stuart Mill
so that all things considered it might be better to leave him.
Yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow,
yet she would feel relieved when he went, yet he was very good
with her husband,
yet his manners certainly wanted improving,
observing too that now she could see the moon itself[strike], &[/strike]
through the staircase window, - the shadowy [strike]dinted[/strike] much
dinted moon - she turned from all this to the very next
moment - Prue & Andrew, Paul & Minta, all opening doors &
coming out into the hall; muffled.
   [strike]Looking[/strike] Coming down stairs, looking out of the window,
then turning [strike]& at once[/strike] Prue saw her mother & felt at
again they
once [strike]two things[/strike] - [strike]that[/strike] how she was a child,
[strike]& she[/strike] had been
feeling extremely old; how that was the crown &
grace of life, her mother coming down stairs, & they all
knew it. Yes; Minta should look at her; Paul should look at her:
143
15
For, she felt, in a way which she could not describe, Here is
the thing itself - her mother [strike]being to her[/strike] having only to appear
to make Prue feel that what they had been playing at was now
[strike][?][/strike] ordered; their going sanctioned, or if not, condemned,
& as nobody else in the kingdom had Mrs. Ramsay for a
mother, this was Minta's great chance, & Paul's - And
her beauty, too, to Prue, always seemed to [strike]be saying to them all,[/strike]
stamp the moment, & she was a little afraid of her, &
actually to
ennoble it,
was her slave, & would never grow up [[strike]?][/strike] or leave home, with
her there, & never wanted to, but only to come out into the
hall & see her coming downstairs, & say to her,
   "We thought of going down to the beach", & [strike]hear[/strike] her
hear
[strike]see[/strike]
sum up the position instantly, [strike]ha[/strike] debate it, should they go, or
should they not go? & ?then decide with that mood of
revelry & [strike][?rather][/strike] which was delicious in her, [strike][?][/strike] & made her
the soul of any junketing, yes, it was quite right to go down to
the beach; & why not swim, & why not catch a fish ... saying
shark
[strike]?which she[/strike] [strike]pulled Mintas[/strike] fastened Minta's cloak about her,
[strike]then[/strike]
saying
& [strike]really[/strike] would have liked to come with them; but
no: there was [strike]William Bankes; there was her[/strike] - her husband,
she meant; she meant to, she wanted to sit down in a
particular chair, under a particular lamp, & taking up her
knitting - [strike]a book[/strike] take up her book.
   They must really not be late she said.
   Had anybody got a watch?
   Paul Rayley of course had a beautiful gold watch,
which he took out of a little washleather bag; & seeing that
bag, Mrs. Ramsay felt how extraordinarily lucky Minta was -
to marry a man who kept a watch in a bag; so she
went into the drawingroom.
   Slightly annoyed about Andrew
144
17
because it was
so foolish
in its
absurdity
The thought, which of course she would not say to anyone, tickled her secretly
& with a smile on her lips she went into the drawing room, where, to her
surprise, there was only her husband, reading.
   However, he did not want to be interrupted - that was clear;
[strike]from[/strike] He was reading - what? something that moved
him,
[strike]to a ?som ?inter[/strike] for [strike]with h[/strike]
besides being intent he was all the time half smiling, & then
as she knew [strike][?][/strike] controlling
his emotion, & yet all the time he
was discriminating & not allowing himself to be unduly
influenced, ?but & weighing one thing with another:
"The Antiquary" - dear old Sir Walter, she thought, smiling [strike]&[/strike]
no longer
[strike]but with[/strike] [strike]?no ?longer[/strike] irresponsibly [strike]anymore;[/strike] ?& sitting down
under her lamp, in her chair, opposite, & taking up her knitting.
For Charles Tansley (instinctively she listened to hear [strike]him[/strike]
of books
bump & bang upon the floor) said he was done for: then
her husband thought,
went & [?]
"That is what they will say of me";
wh he
so he
got The Antiquary, [strike]he[/strike] loved [strike]The Antiquary, but[/strike]
[strike]nothing would ever make him tamper with truth;[/strike] [strike]he would[/strike]
[strike]He might want a thing to be true; but[/strike]
[strike]If he found it[/strike]
But
If his reason told him that it was true - Sir Walter was done for -
then
very well
he would accept that fact:
Except about himself, he
[strike]was rational[/strike] would
accept anything.
Not liking to
think why he was
so irrational about himself so that perhaps
other people, Lily for instance, had guessed at dinner [strike]how[/strike]
why he was so irritable [strike]at dinner[/strike] when they talked about
fame & books lasting, not liking [strike]to[/strike] the sense she had
sometimes
the
that [strike]his[/strike] children wondered, a little, she began her knitting, &
at the same time all those fine [strike]points[/strike] gravings, as with
steel instruments, became drawn again about her
lips & forehead, & she became [strike]like an image which[/strike]
[strike]owing to her beauty,[/strike] [strike]like[/strike] still, & composed, [strike]as if all[/strike]
like a tree which has been tossed & quivering & now, when
the breeze falls, settles into quiet.
   But [strike]then[/strike]
How great a mind he has, she thought.
very much; [strike]& why did it move[/strike]
[strike]him;[/strike]
145
19
She could not judge his mind indeed; [strike]but[/strike] Nor was it intellect, exactly; it was
his way with him; his loftiness; His truthfulness, His - & feeling
rise up in her that same feeling which she had had at dinner
which
[strike]the brooding calm of a[/strike]
soul
?riding the waves, [strike]which[/strike] in a brooding [strike]calm,[/strike]
peace, & [strike]yet[/strike] then somebody begins, the China rose is all abloom &
buzzing with the yellow bee, [strike]come out[/strike] & all the lives we ever
lived & all the lives to be, come out, come out - she
she felt herself
like a leaf
blowing [strike]through a[/strike]
in at a window
[strike]took[/strike] looked over her knitting at the books on her little table, &
took one, an anthology of poems, & opened it [strike]anywhere[/strike], laying it
on her knee,
[strike]And[/strike] [strike]n[/strike]Never reading at all, except in this way,
[strike]she turned leaves,[/strike]
turning leaves, climbing from this to that, she
had not any
[strike]sense of[/strike] security whatever, or any knowledge even, [strike]but[/strike]
of names, but only [strike]how the[/strike] [strike]that the[/strike] [strike]lines[/strike] [strike]about the[/strike]

And she kept turning over the pages & knitting

did not want to be interrupted, for he was being led on, like a fool,

It was a splendid chapter; the humour was magnificent. And

fish
could not help mouthing the Scotch dialect to himself
146
21
He felt fortified, & forgot completely the little rubs & digs of the evening; [strike][?][/strike] its
exasperations & intolerable boredom, feeling now [strike]that[/strike] invigorated by this man's
strength & sanity & his [strike]feeling[/strike] [strike]certainty that[/strike] belief in the straightforward
simple things, which Mr. Ramsay felt so strongly that, when it came to [strike]the[/strike]
poor Steenie's drowning, [strike]the[/strike] he could not choke down his tears, [strike]&[/strike]
but raising the book a little, [strike]sat[/strike] let them fall, & shook his head from
side to side, & forgot completely what he was doing, save for the
sense of his wife there who must not interrupt him - & was
keeping from him he was obscurely conscious, intolerable bores.
Let
them
[strike]It was done.[/strike]
[strike]If they were going to[/strike] improve upon that, he
in his
sympathy &
sorrow for the
[strike]poor old pa[/strike]
poor old
parents
thought, [strike]finishing[/strike] as he finished the chapter. [strike]And[/strike] Immediately,
he began thinking, how it was the old beggars & fishwives Scott was
man
good at; [strike]how[/strike] the lovers were fiddlesticks.
The innocence [strike]of the[/strike]
man was [strike]incred[/strike] astonishing.
He was contemporary with
Balzac after all. But if it [strike]hampered him[/strike] limited him his
lack of interest in these eternal sex problems was also a [strike]source of[/strike]
[strike]th[/strike] one reason for his ?vigour. Mr. Ramsay felt that sex interest was
hugely overdone. If this sort of thing seemed old fashioned to the
young men, [strike]that[/strike] naturally they did not buy his [strike]own[/strike] books,
Mr. Ramsay thought; ?& One ought not to complain; [strike]Here he[/strike]
[strike]looked at his wife,[/strike] if they did not read Scott. Here he looked
at his wife, who was reading & knitting, but, like a person in a
very light sleep, was conscious of the very moment that her
husband shut his book. [strike]She was[/strike] He [strike]often jus[/strike] liked just to look at her
He liked to think that everyone had taken themselves off, & he & she were
alone; [strike]just[/strike] for ten minutes or so
   Mrs. Ramsay raised her head, but like a person in a
light sleep, seemed to [strike]ask[/strike] say that if he wanted her to wake she
would, otherwise she was sleeping. She was rocking; she was
stretched
[strike]sa[/strike] [strike]brooding; on the rhythm, in the[/strike] mesh [strike]stretched tight[/strike] of Shakespeare's
sonnets.
   Well? he said at length. [strike]And[/strike] [strike]At once[/strike] quizzically,
as if he were ridiculing her gently, for being asleep in broad
daylight, [strike]but[/strike] & at the same time hiding the delight of her
147
23
her presence & the immeasurable comfort of her beauty, for he
wrong
thought, it was silly to [strike]think that he had[/strike] reproach himself. [strike][?][/strike]
Neither of them would have lived differently; [strike]he[/strike] to him, [strike]worn as she[/strike]
she was more beautiful now; worn & old; worried; teased; driven to
death with all these people.
   She woke instantly.
Could they have lived differently?
Well, she said, echoing him [strike]dr[/strike] dreamily.
She tried to remember all
that had happened since she had seen him alone: the dinner, & the
& Paul's
watch;
engagement, & the children being awake, & Andrew [strike]in the hall[/strike]
silent
Andrew being so [strike]stiff w[/strike]
[strike]shy[/strike] with her: & what else?
now
   [strike]They have gone down to the beach she said,[/strike]
[strike]She shut he[/strike] Her book shut itself on her knee.
Mr. Ramsay said
the engagement he meant.
that he supposed they had hit it off - [strike]he divined something of the sort.[/strike]
It all seemed to have happened a long time ago; [strike]or[/strike] it seemed [strike]as if[/strike]
[strike]to have become part of their own lives,[/strike]
[strike]But how explain that[/strike]
[strike]feeling? as if Mrs. Ramsay thought,[/strike] It seemed to her that it had
already melted in to the [strike]great[/strike] [strike]thick[/strike] [strike]trunk of[/strike] fabric of
their lives, [strike]&[/strike] like a stream which eddies [strike]round[/strike] at first & then
rushes along in the main current.
She felt that there was
nothing to be said about it.
She felt, especially when she had
?start ?nothing
been reading poetry, [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]how[/strike] little could be said, &
[strike]that[/strike] not ?rightly; & she was coming to shrink from talk more
joking
& more - not light gossip of course or fun
about
(that Paul had a
wash leather bag for his watch) but [strike]who could say what she[/strike]
[strike]felt now?[/strike] about other things - her relationship with her husband, &
the children, & one thing happening & then another things, & the
sense she had that it was all, somehow, right; & yet so
why
[strike]profoundly[/strike] tragic - oh yes:
when ever [strike]she [?][/strike] anything
happened, [strike]it was always the tragic[/strike] was one's first thought of
[strike]tragedy? &[/strike] - always death, somehow, dark somehow; ruin coming.
Only he would say no. [strike]The[/strike] Through the crepuscular walls of their
intimacy, (for they came astonishingly close now & then) she could

call her. He would say she snubbed him. But it was not so - it
was not so. [strike]When she thought how[/strike] Had he not given her

[strike]Now it was so dark that the sea, on either side, seemed like[/strike]

   It grew darker. Clouds covered the moon, & in the early hours
of the morning [strike]the[/strike] a light rain drummed on the roof, &
starlight moon light, or the lights at sea seemed put out. [strike]What[/strike] Nothing
could withstand the flood, [strike]&[/strike] the profusion, the downpouring of
crept
this immense darkness; which seemed [strike]like a flood[/strike] let in at keyholes
[strike]crv[/strike] crevices & stealing round the window blinds, came
[strike]trickling[/strike] in at the bedrooms & sitting rooms, &
[strike]doors of[/strike] swallowed up here the [strike]glint[/strike] white of china &
there the flower, the sharp edged furniture.
When
everything was confused & confounded, there was scarcely
any identity left, either of bodies or of thoughts, [strike]& only[/strike]
From the many [strike]brains sleeping,[/strike] & bodies lying, either in the
cramped
rigid attitudes of the old, [strike]or in flung[/strike]

in the crease of the bed, themselves creased with the habitual
[strike]be[/strike] stoopings & movings of many years, [strike]there[/strike] or easily
lying, scarcely covered, [strike]like children[/strike] in the first years of life.
As if the least cover were too heavy, & the mattress [strike]m[/strike]
only [strike]upheld them an & cradled them[/strike], nothing but dreams
& confused thoughts & broken lights like the the flash &
[strike]glitter[/strike] the bright strange effervescence of bubbles rising
[strike]from[/strike] deep water, which burst when they reach the surface,
keeping, now one [strike]hand was[/strike] a hand was raised, or a

in [strike]the eager tones of the childlike happiness had talked[/strike]

or somebody talked with the confidence of a chattering
child, complete nonsense.
There might have been ghostly

nameless comforters, [strike]who would[/strike] treasure up [strike]in their[/strike] the

Were there ghostly confidantes about, nameless comforters,
gently pacing, gravely stooping; to treasure up, [strike]to[/strike] engulf in the

[strike]the day[/strike] denied them, & to him cried, & to this confided, & to him

Yet if there is no soul, & the day is all, why should

[strike]Curiously, in[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] so that it was hardly possible, however[strike],[/strike]

[strike]And[/strike] But among sleepers

Everything else can tarnish & perish, is

would say to the grey airs of midnight, & the wandering gleams
[strike]which[/strike] of moonlight, of light which waves up the wall &
across the ceiling, phantom soft, how they had no power to
smooth, [strike]to obliterate, to destroy[/strike] touch, or to destroy, upon which,
wearily, ghostlily, as if they had feather-light fingers, &
& the
light persistency
of feathers,

would fold their light garments, [strike]a sigh[/strike], & die away, having
looked upon [strike]eyes[/strike] shut eyes, & fingers loosely closed. They would
now betake themselves to the staircase, [strike]for exam[/strike] to the window
for example; they would nose & rub & fumble the pane;
descending, ruffle the [strike]light[/strike] cloaks in the hall, &
then meditate how to chill the apples in the plate on the
dining room table. Grey dew might bead their [strike]round[/strike] redness, -
their roundness crinkle, soften, & be [strike]stained[/strike] turn brown.
[strike]As for the[/strike] [strike]th[/strike] [strike]if[/strike] They tried the picture on the easel in

been gay, & surely perhaps on the stage twenty years before,
but now, [strike]like a[/strike] coming from the toothless bonneted
old
caretaking woman [strike]had lost its starch, become[/strike] & turned

[strike]All[/strike] humbleness which depressed almost to the

[strike]its sorrow[/strike], & its courage, & its [strike]sidelong persist[/strike] assiduity,
[strike]for rejected[/strike] & its determination, denied one entrance, to

a very

was weary of it all; how it was
not good,

which [strike]could not [/strike]must slip & turn aside, even as she

Oh yes, there had been beauty here, & life here &

& [strike]Mrs. McNab[/strike] yet the living with their mops & their dusters
let issue on the grave of beauty, [strike]a[/strike] this incongruous song, of the
twisted the crazed & the thwarted, who, one [strike]would think[/strike] had
no reason to desire life, no gift to bestow, or [?]fire to take; & yet
as they [strike]lurch & leer, through the[/strike] lurching & leering, at once

they
as
perform the [?]obsequious

[strike]with the dirge & the elegy[/strike] itself an incorrigible hope; a
there twined in
with it
this
[strike]hope founded, in the case of Mrs. MacNab, certainly not on[/strike]
[strike]reason not on[/strike]
a hope
not founded on reason, not founded surely on satisfaction (for
of the town[?]
she was the butt &
outcast) but founded perhaps
([strike]here[/strike]
[strike]as her wits were half crazed[/strike], all conjecture must be
(her cheeks were
yellow & old)
distorted) on the dumb persistency of the fountain of life, &
on moments (say they came obscurely, here & there, at the
wash tub, [strike]in[/strike] with her children who had gone now to
America) [strike]of which[/strike] [strike]breathed[/strike] of illumination, when the
with
breeze [strike]was[/strike] in the west & the clouds white in the sun, &
[strike]standing at her & she & it was some the gift of life[/strike]
she understood [strike]what, in moments of high great emotion[/strike]
[strike]great poets have said whatever it may be that then[/strike]
whatever it may be:
[strike]appears to sweeten labour, & consolatory, & com[/strike]
& beneficent; it seemed better to live; it seemed as if
a channel were tunnelled in the heart of obscurity, &
[strike]the meaning[/strike] & through the rift they made [strike]&[/strike]
there issued peace, enough, when the grind & the
grit returned, to sweeten that barrenness; for
[strike]strangely as[/strike] in her sidelong glance there was,
account for it as one may, the forgiveness of [strike]an[/strike]
[strike]compl[/strike] understanding mind.
   How Mrs. MacNab, of all people, had come to
tolerate & g to forgive, who shall say - Mrs MacNab, the

that the crazed, & the mystic, & the visionary have access to

wind in the West, & the [strike]breeze[/strike] sun upon the clouds. If they
find in them absolute good, an [strike]extra[/strike] lump of sugar more of less
matters nothing. They are warm in the frotst, & have
comforts in the desert. Only Mrs. MacNab was not of these;
she had been drunk in her day, & of her six children, two, it was
said were not by her husband; she had lived, she had loved, in
short, & if consolation came to her it was of some
warmer, subtler kind. Perhaps she had an open heart, a
loving heart, & thus if she asked charity (her caretaking
was given her to help her) [strike]rather than[/strike] she returned it by

her forgiveness.

   Was it, then, that she had her consolation in [strike]moments[/strike] of
[strike]illumination[/strike], when with the breeze in the west & the
clouds white in the sun she stood at her cottage door;
for what reason did there twine about the dirge this
incorrigible hope?, & [strike]how [/strike]why, with no gift to
bestow a no gift to take, did she yet desire life, &
sing, as she dusted & leered [?][strike]how[/strike] Were there then
for Mrs. MacNab, trodden into the mud by civilisation,
a mat for kings & kaisers to walk on, moments of
illumination - at the
washtub, say, with her children?
(Yet two
of them at had been base-born, & three had
deserted her) Some cleavage of the clouds there must have
been; some channel cut in the heart of obscurity through
which issued light enough to make her grin like that - looking
at herself in the long looking glass; & [strike]seeing there a[/strike]
[strike]wisp of[/strike] with her homy[?] forgive, tolerate, understand.
The crazed, the mystic, the visionary are possessed at
long intervals of comprehension, & find in them
some absolute good so that a lump of sugar more
or less matters nothing; they are warm in the frost &
have comforts in the desert.
But Mrs. MacNab was
not of these.
She was not among the [strike]haters of life; not[/strike] among the
skeleton lovers; not among those who voluntarily surrender
[strike]their[/strike], make abstract, [strike]& find in some s[/strike]

unity & its volume & conflict & anguish to one
voice piping clear & [strike]single[/strike] sweet. [strike]Th[/strike] [strike]Thus, when all the[/strike]
[strike]mysti[/strike] When the inspired & lofty minded, who had walked on
167
63
walked on the beach & heard, in some lull of the storm, a
voice, seen a vision, & so [strike]inte[/strike] mounting the
pulpit interpreted the
[?]senseless
& made public how [strike]simple everything is, &[/strike] it is - to love, to worship,
Mrs. MacNab, continued [strike]to muddle things up down below.[/strike]
& drink & gossip [strike]down[/strike] as before[strike].[/strike]: [strike]&[?][/strike]
[strike]s[?] And it seemed[/strike]
as if [strike]the true duty of[/strike] it were in the muddle [strike]&[/strike] of
[strike]un[/strike] & inexplicability of things, the struggle & the [strike]weariness[/strike]
tiredness, [strike]the search the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] that she discovered [strike]not[/strike]
those reasons which she never divulged for [strike]carryi[/strike] opening
the windows & dusting the bedrooms: as if her message to a
world now beginning to burst into the [strike]in[/strike] [strike]w[/strike]
voluntary/loveliness of spring were somehow transmitted
rather by the lurch of the body & the leer of her smile, [strike]by her[/strike]
[strike]than by[/strike] & in them were the broken syllables of a
revelation more [strike]profound, but[/strike] confused, but more
profound
than any accorded to solitary watchers, pacers on the
beach at midnight, [strike]anguished so[/strike] [?] preachers &
diviners.
   Yet to them[strike], too[/strike], as the evenings lengthened [strike]again,[/strike]
[strike]there[/strike] came the strangest intimations, [strike]as if the[/strike]
[strike]su[/strike]
the most authentic beckonings,
[strike]as if[/strike], in the sunset &
the sunrise, in the windy evenings,
[strike]voices a[/strike]

some[strike]thing[/strike] were hailing

out [strike]the[/strike]
of their flesh, [strike]to a[/strike] &
that flesh were
streaming down the
wind, & they
must needs fly
with arms stretched to the
wild [strike]gleaming[/strike] shining west, or the dancing
stars or the m merriment of the waves.
[strike]It seemed[/strike] as if the wave were [strike]them[/strike], [strike]break[/strike] so
proudly arching, [strike]so splendidly sweeping, & the[/strike]

[strike]all[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]all this purity & fierceness,[/strike] & the tree's strength & the
cliffs nobility & the clouds majesty were so
brought together purposely, to body forth a might [strike]which[/strike]

in spring

prepare &,
were so brought together to assemble the scattered parts of the [strike]faith he[/strike] of the
[strike]he[/strike] vision within them. Now displayed [strike]outside them it wa[/strike]
in sky & wind
& what was
in cliff & sea, [strike]what they[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] the thing seemed manifest, outside, & inside,
made
[strike]miraculously[/strike] [strike]seemed[/strike] miraculously one.
   For a week at the end of May this unity [strike]was[/strike] persisted
[strike]&[/strike] The spring without a lea leaf to toss [strike]or a bough to[/strike]
very bare & bright presented itself like a virgin fierce in her
chastity contemptuous in her purity; [strike]&[/strike] [strike]was there,[/strike] in the
[strike]very[/strike]
fields & on the sea,
heartless & [strike]if it were not for[/strike] the
as if
[strike]dreams & desires of the beholders, apparently[/strike] entirely
wide eyed
watchful
laid out,
unconcerned with [strike]their[/strike] [strike]what was done or thought or hoped or[/strike]
feared. [strike]Beauty, she[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]with the dreams & desires of the[/strike]
[strike]beholders[/strike]. with what was done or thought; [strike]by the beholders.[/strike] by the beholders.
[strike]as if the[/strike] Nevertheless, [strike]thes[/strike] [strike]th[?][/strike] dreams persisted; &
it was impossible[strike],[/strike] [strike]so str[/strike] to resist the strange intimation which
&
every gull & flower, [strike]the[/strike] trees - the bright pure earth itself
seemed to declare, but if [strike]one[/strike] questioned [strike]them[/strike] at once to
then
withdraw, [strike]as[/strike] [strike]as to[/strike] the triumph of good, the universality of
things
happiness; [strike]the[/strike] [strike]& again[/strike] or to resist the extraordinary
us
to
stimul[strike]ation[/strike], which seemed urg[strike]ing the one to seek a[/strike]
[strike]people[/strike] hither & thither as if in search of some good, some
hard crystal it [strike]might[/strike] be, entirely remote from [strike]their[/strike]
pleasures
[strike]n[/strike] known & familiar [strike]pleasures &[/strike] virtues; something
altogether alien to the processes of domestic life; something
bright & fierce & hard, [strike]let f[/strike] a crystal laid on a sandy
floor, a diamond glittering in the white dust.
And then,
suddenly, as it seemed conquered & acquiescent, softened now
& tender, the spring seemed to the watchers & pacers who
were seeking a revelation to have knowledge of [strike]their[/strike]
tears: [strike]to[/strike] cloudy, to have compassion, [strike]& all[/strike]
singing
[strike]echoing with birds voices[/strike] & [strike]boys whis[/strike] bees humming & the
& instead of seeking this absolute
the watchers
[strike]pure[/strike]
[strike]& rather[/strike]

[?]thing

170

to have taken on a knowledge of their doubts, of their sufferings,
veiling herself, & [strike]sending blue[/strike] bending her head, & [strike]letting[/strike] her
[strike]compassionate gaze fall[/strike] brooding, in beautiful transient melancholy, in
[strike]sp[?][/strike] flying shadows, in sprinkles of [strike]sof[/strike] small rain,
   Now again when spring was far advanced it was possible to
attempt the house [strike]again[/strike]; [strike]with allies - flies, gnats, spiders, sm wh[?][/strike]
& now[?]
[strike]for allies, so that[/strike] when the wind [strike]& the[/strike] began to breathe & the
shawls & coats to move
[strike]a[/strike]
[strike]there moved with them a[/strike]
with them round & round
flies buzzed in the sun, & there could be heard [strike][?]th[/strike] tapping at the
tall
green
long windows [strike]some[/strike] the leaves of some [strike]quickly shooting[/strike] plant.
The the [strike]light[/strike] stroke of the lighthouse, which had laid itself

with authority upon the [strike]mat[/strike] carpet when the nights were dark,
gliding
[strike]seen[/strike] came [strike]with the moonl[/strike] mixed with moonlight, gently & 
stealthily, [strike][?][/strike] as if it laid its caress [strike]upon[/strike] & lingered was [strike]came[/strike]
& went, & came lovingly again.
But in the midst of this
loving caress, for no reason, - except perhaps that the damp
had loosened it imperceptibly, & the [strike]w[/strike] wind
dislodged it, the shawl burst asunder. Another fold [strike]was[/strike]
had fallen. A long streamer now hung from the
boar's skull & was fanned gently, this way & that way,
in those short spring nights, full of [strike]sl[/strike] [strike]s[/strike] [strike]mo[/strike] [strike]light[/strike] [strike]fro[/strike]
silver from the moon & the lighthouse, & those hot
days, when the grasses scarcely tapped upon the pane, &
only one tortoise shell butterfly dashed from window to
window.

   Now again the wind breathed in the house, flies buzzed round in the
winds
warm yellow spot of sunshine, & [strike]there[/strike] could be heard,
weeds
tapping the window pane, long [strike]grasses[/strike], stray wild flowers,
which had grown close to the glass in the night.
When darkness fell, the stroke of the lighthouse which had
laid itself with authority upon the carpet when the nights
were dark came mixed with moonlight gliding gently &
stealthily as if it laid its caress/ & lingered & looked & went  &
came lovingly again. ...
on the empty
bed
The curved tooth on the lower jaw of the skull was [strike]unc[/strike] laid bare;
& then the [strike]strea[/strike] shawl, which now hung down like a streamer,
waved gently this way & that, throughout the short spring
nights [strike]& the silver robed by the moon & the lighthouse,[/strike] &
the long summer days when all the empty rooms seemed
to [strike]hum with[/strike] murmur [strike]with the[/strike] with the echoes[?] of the
fields & the hum of flies, & the [strike]the[/strike] [strike][?]li[/strike] [strike]light so[/strike]
sun so barred & striped the rooms, [strike]th[/strike] [strike]so[/strike] filled

them with a [strike]liquid[/strike] yellow that Mrs MacNab, when she
hazy
came to dust, looked like a tropical fish, oaring
[strike]her w[/strike] its way through [strike]the[/strike] sun-lanced [strike]water[/strike] sea.
[strike]Up rose the bookcases[/strike] [strike]like[/strike] rocks; [strike]the tables floated like[/strike] islands;
among
[strike]strange[/strike] corals & crystals. [strike]glowed & twinkled on the[/strike]
But slumber though it might without apparent change [strike]through[/strike]
[strike]ran for a[/strike] as [strike]the[/strike] there came later in the summer ominous
sounds [strike]which,[/strike] thuds, rumbles, like [strike]regular[/strike] thunder
regularly repeated, which with their repeated shocks still
further loosened the shawl & [strike]distu[/strike] helped the wind & the

& then, night after night, [strike]the[/strike] & sometimes in plain midday,
when the roses were all blooming & the light was turning its
[strike]shapely[/strike] shape clearly, [strike][?][/strike] seemed to drop a stone in the [strike]w[/strike]
even into this silence, [strike]& this indifference. And[/strike]
this brilliance, this complete indifference.
   Then [strike]the escaped,[/strike] indeed those who had gone down to pace
they
the beach & ask of the sea & sky what message
[strike]it[/strike] reported or
they
affirmed
what vision [strike]it[/strike] [strike]made manifest[/strike], had to consider among
[strike][?][/strike] the usual & the delightful tokens of diving bounty -
such as the sunset on the sea & the colour of the waves
& their frolic & their grandeur  & the the majesty of
the cliffs - something unexpected. For instance, a
the calm
moon
rising
murderous looking ship; [strike]would appear, or,[/strike] leaden, ashen,
sinister; or, a little froth & stain upon the bland surface
of the sea, as if [strike]beneath[/strike] something were foaming [strike]or[/strike] &
[strike]being bitten by sharks be[/strike] boiling beneath.

This intrusion into a scene [strike]which was[/strike] otherwise
calculated to stir the most sublime reflections & lead to the
most comforting conclusions stayed their pacing. If
that snout [strike]out in[/strike] thrusting itself up [strike]in the[/strike] there [strike]expressed[/strike]
[strike]the desire wish to[/strike] meant death, & starvation, [strike]&[/strike] pain,
it was difficult to abolish its significance, & to continue.

The black snout interfered with the whole composition.
Was there no composition at all then? [strike]Was it[/strike]

[strike]Anything was nobler than[/strike] Semblances

After all these years, the books & things were mouldy

dim
A [strike]little[/strike] figure, of a lady in a grey cloak, bending [strike]down[/strike] among white
flowers on a summer's [strike]night, &[/strike] evening appeared here [strike](at her[/strike]
& here & here [strike]as Mrs. Macnab went[/strike], [strike][?]as[/strike] by the open drawer [strike]of[/strike]
by the washstand, by the cupboard as Mrs. Macnab [strike]went[/strike] did
the bedroom - It was [strike]more[/strike] like an image seen through a rather
feeble telescope; [strike]it[/strike] was cut out like that - a[strike] lady in a grey cloak -[/strike]
feeling to it
without [strike]any[/strike] much else, save some queer pleasure, rising in
[strike]Mrs. Macnab's[/strike] old Maggie's brain to think of herself going up
the drive to have her tea perhaps in the kitchen on a
summer's evening when [strike]everything was[/strike] things were better than they
are now. She sighed - she moaned. The little picture
which
[strike]the ghost who[/strike] had come back to the bedroom[strike], like a[/strike]
[strike]for a moment[/strike] to waver across the wall [strike]&[/strike] like a momentary
sunbeam on a cloudy day vanished. Old Maggie saw nothing: [strike]at all.[/strike]
Compared with everything else there - the mahogany chest of
drawers - the brass bedstead - the ghost which old
Maggie had
saw only the
chest of drawers
& the brass
bedstead
which needed
polishing
[strike]Such was the fate of that [?]w ghost.[/strike]
   They survived. [strike]The[/strike] Pleasant ghosts - & she had had a way
with her, Mrs. Ramsay, - [strike]would not[/strike] could not alter those;
could not stay. It was only by fits & starts one [strike]got the[/strike]
thought of them. [strike]A la[/strike] Stooping among her flowers - old
Maggie [strike]might[/strike] say it [strike]herself, but[/strike] but her old crazed
could
wits were flitting off elsewhere; [strike]The[/strike] There was
too much here to do for one [strike]person -[/strike] woman - to do.
too much - too much.
   So, when she had gone, ill temperedly banging the doors,
& forgetting her flowers,
the house seemed like a
shell deserted of life, & given over to moulder on a sandhill.

Then the long night seemed to have set in; the final triumph
of the little airs; the clammy breath, [strike]to be[/strike] was at hand.
Soon some thistle would be thrusting its head between the tiles in
the larder; & the swallows [strike]who had nested yearly in the[/strike]

& the floor would be strewn with straws & [strike]the[/strike] plaster

vision that asked for ratification, either they had been
woken from their dreams by that prodigious cannonading which
had made the wine glasses tinkle in the cupboard, or

that [strike]w[/strike] they had fled. They had gone in despair. They had
dashed the mirror to the ground. They saw nothing more.

For now had come that moment, that crisis, [strike]in the[/strike] when if a
father alight in one scale, it will be weighted down - & so if
if a feather had [strike]blown[/strike] alighted the house would have fallen in:
would have become past repair; & [strike]out[/strike] picnickers, would have
boiled their kettles in its [strike]cr[/strike] ruined rooms, lovers [strike][?][/strike]
sought shelter there, or [strike]som[/strike] the shepherd stored his dinner, &
taken his rest there, with his collie [strike]&[/strike] by his side. Then
[strike]even the[/strike] the walls would have fallen in, & then, [strike]coming[/strike] over
nothing would have
[strike]the hill,[/strike] [strike]only the[/strike] [strike]since the tangled garden could[/strike] [strike]what would have[/strike]
remained to straying into [strike]this wilderness,[/strike] this ruined barn,
one
(for such it seemed) in a wilderness of [strike]old[/strike] unkempt shrubs,
[strike]some[/strike] the only things [?] which would have testified that [strike]here[/strike]
people had lived somewhere about here would have been
the [strike]extraordinary[/strike] apparition of a red hot poker; [strike]The[/strike] a chipped plate.
If the feather had fallen[strike],[/strike] - if it had plunged the scale into
darkness, - but there was a force working on the other side;
something leering & lurching; [strike]something[/strike] not highly conscious of its
own purpose, & certainly not inspired to go about its task with
dignified ritual or solemn chanting. But in old Maggie & her
crony, Mrs. Bast, there was a force: (they came with their
brooms & their pails, they moaned: they crooned. They got to work.)
There was a force perhaps in their craziness, [strike](for without being[/strike]
[strike]locked in danger of locking up, their minds were blank[/strike]
[strike]or vacancy of mind[/strike] which slowly & painfully [strike]began[/strike]
stayed the corruption & the rot; rescued from the
pool of time which was fast closing over them, now a bed now a
basin now a cupboard; fished up from oblivion [strike]the[/strike]
all the Waverley novels, & a tea pot one morning: in the
afternoon restored to the sun & the air a brass fender & a
set of steel pokers & tongs. Some rusted laborious birth
attended with the creaking hinges & the screeching of bolts &

the war had
been about -
did they know?)
something that was

& the slamming & banging of damp-swollen wood [strike]might[/strike]
[strike]have been[/strike] [strike]been[/strike] seemed to be taking place, as the old women
slapped & slammed, upstairs now, now in the cellar.
They drank their tea in the bathroom sometimes, sometimes in the
study; contemplating now, the magnificent conquest of the taps &
the freshly painted bath; now their more arduous &
indeed more partial [strike]conq[/strike] [strike]triump[/strike] [strike]c[/strike] triumph over
innumerable volumes of [strike]old[/strike] philosophy which, black in the
beginning, were now not only puce [strike][?][/strike] coloured [strike]& white[/strike]
with white cascades of damp, but bred little mushrooms -
[strike]seret[/strike] secreted spiders.
[strike]Then,[/strike] suddenly, [strike]her[/strike] as she wiped
[strike]& ba[/strike] them, the telescope fitted itself of its own accord to old
Maggie's wandering eyes, & in a momentary stability she saw
the old gentleman, on the lawn. [strike]He was[/strike] as lean as a rake - He
it wa
[strike]was[/strike] wagging his head. [strike]He[/strike] Was he dead too?
[strike]Some[/strike] said [strike]he,[/strike]
Mr. Ramsay

Ramsay.
some said [strike]she[/strike] He was standing on the lawn;
she could
see him now.
So for a moment the little ghost, held in the charwoman's eye,
revisited the lawn, wagged its head; & recalled [strike]that[/strike] ([strike]who kne[/strike] by some
devious faith) [strike]he[/strike] a joke of Mildreds in the kitchen.
She was
always
hot tempered like all red haired women. [strike]But[/strike] She saved [strike]her[/strike]
a plate of milk soup for Maggie. Mrs. Ramsay quite thought she
needed it, bringing the wash up the hill every step of the way
herself.

which had done very fairly since there was only one square [strike]army of[/strike]
of thick[strike][?][/strike] waving grass yet to be demolished on the lawn
while the [strike]ba[/strike] behind him the shining grass lay prone; the
the curt stubble was crisp. He [strike]brought order &[/strike]
laid low the wilderness with each sweep, & to do him justice was a
steady worker, slow but remorseless, as if each movement were
issued
timed by [strike]an accurate[/strike]
[strike]sent out by the shock of[/strike] his heart, &
from
(a powerful but
[strike]not a[/strike] inarticulate
organ)
sucked in & sent out; so that even now he would waste no
words with the women in the window, only grinned & spat, & resumed
again that rhythmic singsong stroke, which [strike]was[/strike]
advanced like the sweep of an invincible army ove the
& wary
insugr insurgents rioting [strike]before[/strike]
in their tumult [strike]b[/strike] up the
bank & over the lawn & [strike]so[/strike] laid them flat.
   When, at [strike]six[/strike] in the evening, & the pale green swathes
lay twined with convolvulus [strike]or[/strike] wild flowers on the lawn,
&
when the rooks were deliberating, fastidiously, tentatively,
among the tree tops, & [strike]from[/strike] again like some half

At last, [strike]there came in the evening, the when George[/strike] all the labour
stopped: [strike]cloth[/strike] dusters were flicked from the windows: the windows shut;
[strike]were[/strike]
banged to,
keys turned,
they locked the doors, George [strike]shouldered[/strike] his [strike]syth[/strike] stopped, [strike]a[/strike] automatically
still; & then at once, as if the cleaning & the [strike]sy[/strike] [strike]sy[/strike] scything had
[strike]du[/strike] [strike]dulled[/strike] the sound, [strike]began that half heard melody[/strike] with the
rooks deliberat[strike]e[/strike]ing fastidiously tentatively among the tree tops,
that half heard melody, that adumbrated music which
the ear half catches but lets fall - cries, shouts, bark, far or close at hand -
so widely spaced
is it, & half close &
half faint, half
here, & half
far away,
[strike]wrapped up in the mesh of summer stillness & suddenly[/strike]
[strike]h[/strike] was [strike]heard, & lost, & that music began[/strike], & then the [strike]rooks,[/strike]
creaking of the rooks joined with it, - rising fully deliberating
above the tree tops, & then the insects cheeped & then the
where it lay
the cut grass started & shiver[strike]s[/strike]ed [strike]ran through it,[/strike] but
[strike]always with notes were dropped, &[/strike] & gradually, with the
sunset, [strike]peace[/strike] sharpness was lost; & like a mist rising,
quiet rose, the rooks settled, the grass settled[strike].[/strike], [strike]At[/strike]
[strike]ease, & loosened loose,[/strike] [strike]Freedom & ease, content & peace[/strike] was the
[strike]lot of the[/strike] whole world shaking itself down to sleep, darkly
& palely caught by flowers.
   [strike]Then, in the darkness, the [?]unl restless spirits who[/strike]
[strike]had left their beds to ask what fate meant, what God meant, to[/strike]
[strike]what destiny the ball of the world rolled, could once more[/strike]

Then [strike]when[/strike] calm had returned[strike],[/strike]. Peaceful messages breathed from the
waves [strike]on the beach, &[/strike] to the house. Never to break its
sleep again, [strike]never to to[/strike] to lull it rather more calmly, [strike]no[/strike] more
there, in bed,
sweetly to rest. What ever they
dream holily wisely, we confirm; -
what else were they murmuring?
And behold, - [strike]yes[/strike]
[strike]Indeed,[/strike] their message, their wisdom, no sooner was it
thought than they wore it a garment of splendour;
[strike]cast it like a[/strike] swept it [strike]over[/strike] [strike]swirled it, & they[/strike] the
wave swept up the beach. Then, like a [strike]th[/strike] mind so

deep in contemplation that its least thought it [strike]full, & is returning to[/strike]

Each wave [strike]seemed to[/strike] added, if one walked there, with the

   [strike]"[/strike]Then what does it mean, what can it mean?" Lily Briscoe asked
all
herself, wondering whether, since they had all disappeared, it
behoved her to go to the kitchen for another cup of coffee or to
wait here. So [strike]inappropriately[/strike], [strike]by[/strike] using a catchword picked up
a
from some book or other she tried [strike]to[/strike] [strike]contract her myriad emotions,[/strike]
this first morning at the Ramsays [strike]again[/strike], to contract her myriad
emotions; to make some phrase resound where there was nothing,
with [?]
to cover the blankness of her mind. For really what did one feel?
Nothing ?nothing
[strike]At this[/strike] moment, not much. She had arrived [strike]rather[/strike] late [strike]the[/strike] night;
& dark & strange
was
When it
[strike]It had been[/strike] very beautiful, & not real. Now she was awake: sitting
at the breakfast table
in her old place, [strike]at ?Mr. Ramsay's right hand[/strike].
It was very early —

not quite eight. They were going to the Lighthouse —

Mr. Ramsay, Cam & James. They had to be off [strike]to catch the[/strike]
[strike]tide,[/strike] [strike]early:[/strike] they had to catch the tide, or something: [strike]& they were late.[/strike]
Cam was not ready
[strike]So[/strike] Mr. Ramsay had lost [strike]his temper[/strike] So James was not ready;
Nancy had forgotten the sandwiches, or something. & So Mr.
Ramsay had lost his temper. There he was marching up &
?slamming
down on the terrace outside. [strike]&[/strike] One could hear doors banging all
to order
& barged out 
of the
room
over the house, & [strike]once[/strike] Nancy had burst in, [strike]with all sorts of[/strike] things

[strike]probably was[/strike] not.
For [strike]how ?co[/strike] who was going to answer her question?

[strike][/strike][strike]so vivid, so real: & ?close & glaring.[/strike] & yet unrelated; as if she
why indeed [strike]h[/strike] did anything happen as it did happen?
For she had no attachments or relations it seemed; she was [strike]set down[/strike]
[strike]here among[/strike] sitting among clean cups at a long table alone.
& for a moment, [strike]with extreme[/strike] vividness, felt cut off from all

quality —
 it was

[strike]As if at last ?one saw the extraordinary nature of existence,[/strike]
[strike]was made plain, & one could some little as if some[/strike]
[strike]link had broken.[/strike] As if some link had broken & at last one
realised how extraordinary it was —
How aimless, how
chaotic, how violent, she thought — & really,
whatever one might
say,
almost entirely without
or thought or anything
feeling or reason.
There was Mrs.
Ramsay dead,
Andrew killed; Prue dead too:
Then they all got together & [strike]said[/strike]
[strike]had breakfast, & Mr. Ramsay[/strike] like this in a house on a bay [strike]& began[/strike]
by [?why]?
poured out coffee [strike]at eight in the morning[/strike]
But
[strike]Heaven knows what its all about,[/strike] &
she had to keep saying to
is
this is tragic
herself [strike]what a tragedy,[/strike] [strike]now[/strike] terrible this is, how [strike]ter[/strike] awful,
not to see Mrs. Ramsay sitting there as she used to sit; when
really [strike]what she felt was that was all forced & put on[/strike]
on earth do we do it?
She did not feel it; she felt nothing: only
why? [strike]why? why?[/strike]
   Suddenly
Mr.
Ramsay looked at her, through the bay window.
[strike]He was thoroughly out of temper, & so[/strike] although she had finished her
coffee, she pretended to drink, in order to keep [strike]that terrible[/strike], [strike]that[/strike]
him
sinister [strike]that[/strike] man at bay. All she had heard from him this morning was
scolding —
 scolding [strike]the[/strike] Nancy, scolding James & Cam.
Old Mr. Carmichael had taken his coffee out on to the lawn —

It [strike]was[/strike] odd to be able to notice everything with extreme
accuracy, &
?When ever
anything
happened
she asked
why

life.

because it was so peaceful perhaps. [strike]But it was uncomfortable[/strike]
[strike]rather than painful[/strike] But it was not painful to her, only
extremely uncomfortable, & yet suppose that all one's life [strike]one[/strike] had
[strike]lived[/strike] in a dream, & this was true, [strike]one could not help being[/strike]
been
Lily Briscoe thought, putting her empty cup down again, as ?Mr.
Ramsay had passed on.
At any rate, she thought, looking [strike]about[/strike]
[strike]round the[/strike] at an engraving on the wall opposite, one must take one's

by the kicks & plunges of an unruly horse, with a back like a
[strike]sharp[/strike] knife board.
What is it?" she asked herself again,
[strike]as if she[/strike] with an odd feeling that she had very nearly laid hold

or almost
[strike]upon something[/strike] [strike]of the highest importance[/strike] —
 actually had grasped
?get
something — like

everything together: [strike]so[/strike] that it was all right —
 the misery, the
scolding —
 these eternal questions which, [strike]what[/strike] everything that
&
happened now seemed to set banging & swinging inside her.
[strike]Oh, Nancy[/strike]

[strike]& carrying on a conversation with someone inside, about its[/strike]

And what relation is that — "seeing people"?
The hideous callousness, the
entire temporariness, [strike]?oh[/strike] & the ramshackle jerrybuilt houses

his presence permeated, pervaded. One could not [strike]ignore[/strike] him,

even at the end of the terrace, with his back turned. He would be

Lily Briscoe, [strike]flourish[/strike] with her brush trembling slightly in her
[strike]hand[/strike] looked at the scene [strike]which[/strike] she was going to paint -

No thing, thought Lily Briscoe; [strike]th[/strike] there she had sat, with James,
ten years ago. Now she was gone.
But why repeat [strike]these[/strike] this? Why [strike]try to bring up from a[/strike] be

They ought not to ask all this; she ought not to have come. And at
forty four, she thought, one cannot waste weeks [strike]on[/strike] when one is 44.
For she was utterly unable to concentrate her mind on what she was
doing. [strike]No thing so annoyed her as[/strike] She held a brush; but
like this
it was irritating to hold a brush
[strike]merely for[/strike] show; a brush, the

[strike]that they possessed, they[/strike] they had blazed up
with every appearance of genuine exaltation, & a blaze which
was certainly one of the most beautiful things on earth (she
could remember the look on Mrs. Ramsay's face) into complete

joyousness in the fulfilment of instinct; & delight in

[strike]Old maidishness was her dower.[/strike] She knew what he was about to say.
Then he looked out to sea. Their eyes rested on the lighthouse
together. Was it going to be calm enough to land? she asked.
Never did anybody sigh as he sighed.
Without concealment, or
shyness, with the force of some primeval gust,
all he had suffered - [strike]his wif[/strike] the death of wife, of son, of
daughter - [strike]filled[/strike] seemed suddenly to fill him & to issue in
a sigh of such despondency that any woman in the whole
world would have known exactly what to do: any woman,
except myself, thought Lily. I am an outcast, an old
maid; something that has no right to exist, she thought

keeper's son, with a tuberculous hip.
   Any woman in the whole world would [strike]be feeling pity &[/strike]

yet all she wished was that this enormous flood of grief, this
insatiable hunger for sympathy, this great man who
[strike]was, she felt certain, mysteriously connected with the[/strike]
this nobility this incorruptible integrity should go, should leave her;
(he was a great

herself)

weight of [strike]grief &[/strike] sorrow & regret & [strike]something[/strike] & all the

[strike]he had[/strike] had his doubts about this table; whether it was the true one,
perhaps, or the only one, or whether [strike]a[/strike] it was worth the time he gave to it-
He had had doubts, she felt, & that was what sometimes they
talked about - Mr. & Mrs. Ramsay - till late at night, & then
Mrs. Ramsay looked tired, & then she Lily flew into a rage
with him. And now he had nobody to [strike]say[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] tell him
she suspected
that the table was there & he had found it; so that
he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, & his
face had that touch of desperation in it, of exaggeration,
which

a [strike]most[/strike] surprising recovery of sense & interest & humanity; which
passed (for he never concealed a feeling) & [strike]felt with[/strike] into that final

[strike]su[/strike]

mood, that mood which [strike]without being exalted, was[/strike] was not
exalted or remote or austere any longer but expressed
the serenity of a mind [strike]that has ceased to worry or[/strike]
which has shed its worries & its vanities, & perhaps lost its
ambitions, but is yet drawn on, as she had seen him
drawn on, at the head of that little procession to the beach,
steadily out of one's range. An extraordinary face it was to watch -

[strike]It was as[/strike] if something [strike]sn[/strike] snapped; a bramble flew back in her face;
she was stung, shocked, yet exhilarated. So roughly her
meditations were broken short. & at once, with enormous relief
she saw
[strike]she looked for the first time, at[/strike] her canvas. [strike]It was[/strike] as if it

as
[strike]tr[/strike] trooped off the field; [strike]&[/strike] then, peace. She looked blankly at the

picture she wished to paint
easel anyhow; without considering the [strike]angle[/strike] nature of the

automatically - in [strike]London, or[/strike] the Brompton Road, or before her
looking glass, when she was pretending to comb her hair. [strike]Now,[/strike]
But there was all the difference in the world between this
involuntary making of pictures in her minds eye, & actually
laying her brush on them. Now was the disaster, the danger.
   She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation, & also
pitched her easel wrongly. She now [strike]adjusted the[/strike] fixed the little

Lily stepped back & screwed up her eyes;
Committed to this particular adventure, she was now sternly set, - & was
out
becoming momentarily more & more indifferent to her own
fortunes, [strike]as a[/strike] to [strike]her own person[/strike] & arms & legs & hair & complexion
& whether it were time for this or time for that, & if she
who she was & what she was
was liked or disliked or [strike]who she was[/strike] & all the rest of it
affected one as a work of art she thought
[strike]That was perhaps an explanation[/strike]

about human relationships & death & art & life: - [strike]sometimes[/strike]
grew dark like a cloud about to burst & one thought This is the

answer. That [strike]among us there are[/strike] creators among us &
Mrs. Ramsay was one of them; [They say to life "Stand still there"]
was true perhaps, she thought. [strike]And[/strike] [strike]t[/strike]They say to life "Stand
[strike]still there," & they enforce[/strike] it; bringing together the wall, the sky, the
hedge - [strike]but it was the[/strike] whatever it might be, herself, Charles Tansley, the
draw

[strike]An artist, a creator -[/strike]
en
[strike]Sure enough, thinking[/strike] And circling [strike]like[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] Charles Tansley again,
running over him, as she [strike]stepp[/strike] chose another brush, she
thought how it was not necessarily angular & ?sensibly
like anybody
else,
just talking,
sandy haired & repulsive, his home & his children;
but on a summer evening they would sit together on a terrace,
talking; & again he would be perfectly simple, himself, a
as on the beach, when Mrs. Ramsay did it, by looking over her
spectacles & saying "Is that a lobster pot?"
All was silence. [strike]in[/strike] Nobody even yet seemed to be stirring in the
house. [strike]It was still early of course; & perhaps they were not even up yet -[/strike]
She looked [strike]at it,[/strike] before [strike]placing her[/strike] [strike]going on, looked[/strike] at the
[strike]peaceful[/strike] house, sleeping there in the early sunlight with its
windows green & blue with the reflected leaves; &
And now indeed she was thinking of Mrs. Ramsay. She was
feeling strangely, remotely with this extreme unreality
211
155
[strike]which seemed to her so much more real than[/strike]
Not the Mrs. Ramsay of flesh & blood; but this other, [strike]the[/strike] who was remote &
hidden [strike]&[/strike] [strike]this[/strike] [strike]spirit[/strike] laugh, [strike]&[/strike] [strike]this[/strike] an essence, something gone

moulding one's thoughts. [strike]Who[/strike] It was all Mrs. Ramsay doing still -
that she thought tenderly of Charles.
Still she prevailed -
Faintly almost imperceptivly she made herself felt. She had
put off the robe of ?flesh & taken on another.
For
Lily never saw
her now. [strike]She[/strike] sometimes she thought of her.
only
The [strike]white[/strike] still house seemed in consonance with this; & the
thin smoke; & the [strike]clear[/strike] fine early morning air.
[strike]She wished to share her[/strike] [strike]Little as it was[/strike] It was unreal, it was

   For now [strike]it was[/strike] the horror was on her [strike]again[/strike]: the

But [strike]she stopped[/strike]. As if impelled by some curiosity which she must
gratify or driven by some discomfort which she must assuage,
she went a pace or two to the end of the lawn, [strike]whence she could[/strike]

Down there among the little boats [strike]to[/strike] [strike]anchored[/strike] which floated

Cam curled up in the bow; & they would not say anything;

chiselled & shaped, compared with the brown thick mass of
Macalisters hand; & [strike]there[/strike] on his
little finger he wore a ring.

For instance, Minta Doyle & Paul Rayley. Minta, as Mr.
Bankes [strike]pointed out[/strike], had holes in her stockings. [strike]There was[/strike]

about [strike]as[/strike] taking great steps; jumping, kicking.
[strike]A[/strike]
[strike]These[/strike] holes might be accidental; or might on the other

was not like that.
She did

She [strike]sought something[/strike] She wore an old shooting cap, Lily remembered.
She [strike]threw a shawl round her.[/strike] She clapped it casually on her head.
It seemed as if a lustre rested there, on the step; as if the thought of her
[strike]were[/strike] composed [strike]like a dream[/strike] itself at once into [strike]a statuesque[/strike]
shape that mourned; [strike]a grieving[/strike] he had been so beautiful; &

[strike]Her [/strike]Where was
that woman gone?
And sure enough, something swam up there on the [strike]s[/strike] drawingroom
steps: the shape of a woman, beautiful, silent with downcast eyes.
She was extremely beautiful - She [strike]said[/strike] was musing, pondering.
[strike]She was like a[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]figure of[/strike] She
[strike]about her,[/strike] But what did she mourn? Why was she grieving?
Why
[strike]What[/strike] had death given her the part to play that was none of hers
in life? Yet, the longer she looked, the more
plainly Lily could see before her that astonishing beauty; & it

as she had seen so many [strike]changes &[/strike] things. [strike]Now[/strike] they [strike]eye brought[/strike] came back;

Mrs. Ramsay was always running. [strike]She had[/strike] [strike]it seemed[/strike]

   And that was part of the charm at least - the discrepancy. For
there it remained dominant, on the drawing room steps, the

[strike]She wa[/strike]
[strike]Mr. Carmichael[/strike]
225
183
But what was the look she had when she clapped her deer stalkers
hat on her head, or ran across the lawn in galoshes to find slugs?
who could tell her, who could help her?
Mr. Carmichael?
   He lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch
flowing down
his beard with the yellow stain resting upon his breast. He was no
longer reading, but had the appearance of some vast brute which is now
[strike]ruminating &[/strike] has gorged itself & is now ruminating.
The
His book,
which [strike]she took to be the[/strike] [strike]had supplied he[/strike] was his [strike]?sour[/strike] source of
that
nourishment, lay fallen on the grass:
Lily had a sense of the
[strike]overpowering[/strike] [strike]some[/strike] felt that it gave off the
as if the
incense of poetry,
lay smoking in the grass; & the fumes of words
there
[strike]rose[/strike] permeated
words
[strike]rose[/strike] [strike]slow[/strike] & [strike]ascend[/strike] [strike]through[/strike] the old man's [strike]being[/strike] [strike]brain,[/strike] being,

given his body its
bulk, its lethargy, & his eyes their [strike]sno[/strike] smoky look, as if
the mind burnt [strike]behind a[/strike] deeply behind a [strike][?][/strike] clouded window pane.
Thus he would lie by the hour, she remembered, &
she could still see him slouching past the window, where Mrs.
Ramsay sat, furtively, [strike]?&[/strike] clumsily as if he wished
to escape
detection, but she always stopped him.
She could not
indure that anyone should [strike]feel out of things.[/strike]
feel unhappy
She tried to draw
him in. But somehow she was never successful.
She
& ?knew that anyone
resented, Lily suspected, anyone [strike]who had no need of her.[/strike]
not
should [strike]be[/strike] [strike]wld[/strike] [strike]independent[/strike] of her: that any man should: &
have no
need of her
Mr. Carmichael [strike]was the exception among men: he[/strike]
[strike]did not depend on her.[/strike] was oddly aloof: he had no needs, Lily
thought;
He shared that unpleasant peculiarity with her.
For she had no needs either.
She painted; he wrote.
But Mrs. Ramsay [strike]was[/strike] - the one who ex [strike]put[/strike]
[strike]pulled up the weeds, or[/strike] searched out slugs, (her
children said she could see a slugs egg half across the
garden) & pried with her spectacles [strike]on[/strike] into dishes,
when she was [strike]?broiling[/strike] dropping laurel or sherry;
shred by shred, drop by drop, to concoct some
[strike]amazing[/strike] triumph of cookery, [strike]wanted[/strike] [strike]so[/strike] [strike]was only[/strike]
infinitely preferred
so [strike]much preferred[/strike] life.
Could she have stood painting,
226
185
could she have lain reading a whole morning in the garden?
It was unthinkable.
She disappeared.
Without saying a word
the only token of her errand [strike]being[/strike] a basket on her arm.
She went off, to the town, to the poor, to the stuffy [strike]little[/strike] rooms, the
little
the close, the sordid
rooms, where [strike]old[/strike] suffering women,
men crushed by [strike]some[/strike] accident in the prime of life, languished,
died with the torture before them of children left or wives left;
to live There she came. And [strike]once,[/strike] Laugh who would

But
[strike]more[/strike] action & thought were not needed.
Perhaps it was Mrs.
Ramsay's beauty. Anyhow, Lily could not help it: [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]thought[/strike] followed her often going to the town with her
basket, silently: she noted her return. She thought
Eyes that are closing in pain & despair have looked on you. She
thought, [strike]your[/strike] beauty has been with them. She adored
that goodness. [strike]from the bottom of her heart.[/strike]
227
187
[strike]But h[/strike] But bulk & mass, the line of the house [strike]central[/strike] going so, the line of the
going

hedge so [strike]made it the[/strike] [strike]imposed their laws on her.[/strike]
stared [strike]out[/strike] at her. We are your [strike]sl[/strike] masters; [strike]Your allegiance is to us,[/strike]
seemed to say

Mrs. Ramsay coming back, figure to herself, [strike]wonderingly,[/strike] the
&
how she [strike]was led to ?ca these ?journey instinctively[/strike]
the kind of
instinct within, [strike]of her,[/strike] how [strike]she was inspired to[/strike]
there was within her a natural instinct like the swallows for the
south; like the artichoke for the sun - Lily could find no
image for that natural instinct, [strike]which[/strike] turning her to the
[strike]sufferings &[/strike] human race, making her seek her nest in its heart.
Could she have stood painting with a woman dying[strike],[/strike]; a woman
?
needing sheets[strike], or[/strike] to her bed, or food? ?There was always a woman
dying. Misery prevailed Such foothold as they had won (herself &

that was [strike]her method of[/strike] help[strike]ing[/strike] the dying woman, she
reflected; she had painted twenty dozen pictures, most of which

Never mind. It was in obedience to an instinct, a commanding, an

Moreover, explain it who could, she believed that [strike]she[/strike]

in for a word

;
[strike]The wall, the hedge,[/strike] the
[strike]house; could[/strike] she have made [strike]that[/strike]
Could she have painted that
picture, she would have done more to help
the dying woman -
[strike]no[/strike] neither

[strike]But let us put it like this then:[/strike] But the way to put it
[strike]was more like[/strike] this - Yet a [strike]?world[/strike] st, which
the soul, [strike]turns away[/strike] it must be confessed, she thought,
a
that the mind [strike]turns[/strike] has

a sense of
reaching some more [strike][?][/strike] acute
reality where
it can rest
   That reality seemed now [strike]all[/strike] [strike]al[/strike] all
round her. Some line had gone happily, or it
might be, the friction of work had heated her
mind
229
191
[?]
to such a heat of illusion
that its fire light glowed
upon the landscape & made her
see [strike]the[/strike] [strike]wha[/strike] the drawingroom
steps & the wall & the hedge in some [strike]a[/strike] illusory, yet apparently
[strike]such[/strike] [strike][?][/strike]
Everlasting & undeniable [strike]rel[/strike] relationship
[strike]where they themselves were[/strike] openly & freely [strike]a[/strike] [strike]expressed.[/strike]
As the mouth ?drew [strike]Her mind[/strike] ?How could she doubt it?
She was extended, & freed; [strike]&[/strike] [strike]she became all fire herself.[/strike]
[strike]She had passed[/strike]
[strike]It[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] she was cut loose from
the
ties of life; she enjoyed that intensity & freedom of life
which, for a few seconds after the death of the body, one
imagines the souls of the dead to enjoy: one imagines then
that they have gathered themselves together & [strike]can[/strike]
[strike]they become,[/strike] [strike]for those moments, how infinitely[/strike] [strike]inten[/strike]
&
complete & forcible with the force of an organism
which is now at last able to unite all its powers.
   [strike]Some mystic idea[/strike]

with an emotion, which could be compared only with the
gratification of [strike]hum[/strike] bodily human love.

all separation is over, except that

[strike]final[/strike] delight of separation - that it [strike]can be[/strike] has
bodies
consciousness of mixing - [strike]the[/strike] [strike]two people[/strike] unite;
the human love has its gratification.
But that, even,
was less complete than this; for who can deny it?
Even while the arms are locked, or the sentence married in the
air with complete understanding, a cloud moves across
the sky; & i[strike]n[/strike] each lover knows, but cannot confess,
his knowledge of the transience of [strike]all[/strike] love: the
mutability of love: how tomorrow comes; [strike]how[/strike] they
?they
words other kisses.
&
[strike]But[/strike] & they are only
tossed together & nothing survives.
   But here, since the lover was the [strike]horrible[/strike]
formidable enemy - space - their union, could it be achieved,
was immortal.
No cloud moved, in that landscape; no
death came [strike]nowhere,[/strike] between them.
It was an awful
marriage; [strike]&[/strike] forever.

   And now he must do without, she supposed. Now he must suffer;

double effect of reality & unreality due, she supposed, to
her return after all these years, so that whatever happened

[strike]It was[/strike] as [strike]if[/strike] [strike]And then, as[/strike] She thought, too, of things that had

But you will notice that there is a
note of interrogation at the end of my title.
[strike]For[/strike] It is true that
[strike]though[/strike] [strike]o[/strike]One may think about reading as much as one chooses, but it is
impossible
[strike]abominable[/strike] to lay down any sort of law about it.
Here, in this
room, we breathe the air of freedom. There are no laws, no
[strike]inequal[/strike] law givers. Each man & woman has to make up his
mind for himself.

Perhaps it is the better & more important point. To get the shock in
[?]
strongly & [strike]clearly[/strike] [strike]as possible[/strike] [strike][?] [?][/strike] as :
as [strike]much[/strike] personally as possible is perhaps the [strike]better[/strike]
the most necessary of all things. Without that private -
peculiar feeling, we [strike]cannot build or[/strike] all reading is dust & ashes.
But once received, there comes the much more curious task of
discriminating, sorting out & judging.

she was, in this boat,
with her father & [strike]James[/strike] & the Macalisters &
James.
   The compact between them held;
the chuckling, the
rushing:
here
life formed
itself round
in the little
circle.
For this was now real: the boat; the sea; her father, & the Macalisters
& James.
[strike]Only, again,[/strike] [strike]what was[/strike] this [strike]new experience[/strike] - was
[strike]strange, this was new: this was extremely exciting.[/strike]
And in this lay the light of something so new that it is strange; &
unreal; & infinitely exciting; she looked at James.
& tyranny with
   Their compact held; to resist coercion to the death.
But
he was changed. Steering, with his eyes fixed on the sail,
frowning slightly, he looked as if he too [strike]were[/strike] [strike]had been[/strike]
[strike]were now,[/strike] & isolated, & [strike]lifted[/strike] cut off from the things they
both knew; so that they were no longer the
'children',
but
who had overslept & been scolded:
[strike]no longer[/strike]
something
had come between them & separated them & made them
strange to each other.

[strike]His[/strike]
for [strike]though[/strike] having looked at the shore
& located with his keen longsighted eyes the position of the
house, he [strike]was made to feel,[/strike] felt again come over him
a sense of some [strike]thing[/strike] wrong, some harm, some perfidy
offered him which threw him for redress upon the
sympathy of the world.
If the whole world had occupied itself
solely in weeping his sorrow? that tribute would not have been
too great. [strike]He needed[/strike]
The whole world should have been composed

coveted most [strike]fixedly[/strike] of endless inexhaustible sympathy -
sympathy in which he could bathe, to which he could return -
For who had ?perished & been more tortured than he - [strike]who[/strike]
his son, his daughter his wife all gone; ?& he left alone,
worn, aged, broken hearted - the words came
to his lips in a
curious ambling singsong; [strike]&[/strike] aged & broken
hearted, he would
murmur, & feel
nothing but the exquisite delight of the sympathy
which the world he was imagining would give him -
so
that sometimes [strike]in a queer dramas[/strike] minutes
fled in these queer
dramas in
which he beheld himself,
[strike]the stake[/strike] like the
lonely stake, the beaten poll
(& here he looked at his hands
which were lean enough
to
confirm the dream) & then
[strike]again[/strike] beheld the divine faces of comforters looking up at him
& offering him the solace of innumerable sighs; imploring
him to tell them what he suffered; [strike]& then[/strike] which he would
recite, in words
which
& get again
the divine [strike]im[/strike] relief of
succeeding each other

[strike]spoken together;[/strike]
& [strike]so this[/strike]
this would go on [strike]until, a[/strike] repeated & repeated, &, failing &
being renewed, until it would seem to him suddenly

in which he could be the actor, &
?who

[strike]stop.[/strike] stopped.
   [strike]Was ?there[/strike] [strike]Cam: James.[/strike] old Macalister. The Lighthouse.
   Look at the house! he repeated.
And now James turned his head to look over his shoulder
201
as his father bade him.
   For now again, woken from this drama of the lean form crucified,
& the women endlessly pitying, he must make them - the children -
happy; friendly; must see that they grow up admiring, loving,
courageous; must fortify them with memories implant in them
some help against the battle [strike]of life[/strike] before them.
Had
Cam looked?
   He [strike]asked her[/strike] waved his hand so that they should
both look; & [strike]began telling them both[/strike] how
   But Cam could not see the house. She was shortsighted,
like her mother. She could see nothing clearly.
And [strike]this[/strike]

used to judging distances & keeping landmarks in view,
[strike]this[/strike]
he could see
clearly, ?everything;

[strike]which[/strike] what should he say to her?
How should [strike]he approach her?[/strike]
How should he control [strike]this[/strike] his hand &
his voice & his ?face, & all the obedient [strike]?now[/strike] quickly [strike]forming[/strike]

these seventy years now? [strike]How should he dodge that[/strike]

[strike]way of truth. They judged him.[/strike]

They judged him:
was humiliating
[strike]But[/strike] he was old, worn, tired: true[strike],[/strike].
Ah, he would not gesticulate. He would [strike]find something to say.,[/strike]
   [strike]How[/strike] was the puppy unhappy, left alone. "Who was going
to take it out today?" he asked her. & James
thought pitilessly, now she will give way. Now

I shall be left alone to carry out [strike]my[/strike] the vow - [strike]which was to[/strike]
He had sworn it in the garden when he was a child: to resist
206
205
tyranny to the death.
Decked in a thousand brilliant colours,
this vice came among men. [They were affective; & they conquered]
People always went under to [strike]them:[/strike] the tyrants; women [strike]did[/strike] in
particular; [strike]but the loathsome vice always showed through[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]it all. He might charm, he might preach; he might be[/strike]
[strike]a great man for anything James knew;[/strike]
They charmed. They wheedled.
Now he was wheedling Cam, about
this puppy; & she would give way; & the compact would be left to him
carry out. to resist tyranny to the death.
[strike]But she did not answer.[/strike]
upon
Sometimes [strike]a[/strike] [strike]over[/strike] a hill that has been green & bright &
sunny, a cloud falls; gravity descends; there, among all
the miles of surrounding brightness, alone is gloom &

sadness; for a moment, for a space.
So [strike]now[/strike] & if one can
fancy thought among hills & high places,
it would seem as
if they must ponder the fate of the clouded & darkened;
so
Cam was [strike]sudd[/strike] overcast now, with the cloud that rested on her,
of the whole burden & battle & ?desaster of life; & how
impossible of solution; & how her father's voice asking who
was to take the puppy out, [strike]was[/strike] cleft her, [strike]for she[/strike]

abandoned, the criminals, who when the gates shut on
them, repent their crime, & beg forgiveness; [strike]but there[/strike] is
[strike]always[/strike] a lawgiver, stern & just, [strike]who[/strike] forbids forgiveness, &
[strike]rightly[/strike] too; a lawgiver who has somehow laid open
upon his knees the tablets of eternal wisdom;

& rightly
of all human qualities she revered justice most, she
thought;
her brother was most godlike;

existence like this, she thought, still gazing
at the
shore, whose points were unknown to her, with one will

[strike]impressions of sights & sounds, of scents, & wh voices, of dresses[/strike]
[strike]rustling, of bracelets tinkling, & the white underside of leaves, of the[/strike]

[strike]part in making them as[/strike] how should he single out from all this,
[strike]& the[/strike] impressions which had fallen on him, [strike]on h[/strike] & on her too,

Well, if Cam would not speak to him, he would bother her, [strike]no more,[/strike]
thought Mr. Ramsay.
But she would speak to him, if she could think of anything, firm &
fierce, & disinterested, loyal to the compact, yet just to [strike]the[/strike] his
demand he made; & yet his integrity, his truthfulness - for, she
thought, looking stealthily at her brother, who kept his eyes
dispassionately on a certain spot in the [strike]?su[/strike] curve of the sail,
now, & then looked aside at the grey [strike]tower[/strike] of the lighthouse,
[strike]you're are free;[/strike] [strike]from his[/strike] you're not exposed [strike]to a pressure which[/strike]
[strike]she felt[/strike] it - to this curious pressure, she meant this

no one
attracted her more than this strange old man. His hands were beautiful; &
his [strike]strong,[/strike] shapely feet. His voice was beautiful, & his words. [strike]He[/strike]
Above all, his haste & his fervour; his oddity; his ridiculousness; his
extreme
burning energy; & his remoteness; [strike]& his[/strike] But what remained
he was
beautiful; he
was e
intolerable, & would forever indicate as with the sudden[strike]l[/strike][strike]y[/strike]

enough to quell the stormiest passion of her heart,

demand upon her, upon James, upon the whole world perhaps; Submit to me.
So she would not say.
210
213
[strike]Give me what I want, because my need is so enormous; that was[/strike]
[strike]his demand. But his need was not greater than other peoples. Her's[/strike]
[strike]even[/strike]

   Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, watching the boat
with the brown sails flatten itself upon the water & [strike]pass[/strike]

were they

herself turning back to her easel?
For [strike]her[/strike] the sympathy
It was always the same.
She had never been able,
she had not given him weighed on her.
[strike]all the years she h[/strike] when she stayed there, to praise him.
She had always left that to people like Minta Doyle.
That was a
pity perhaps.
It reduced their relationship to something
neutral, without that element of sex which had made his
manner to Minta Doyle so gallant, almost gay.
He
would pick a flower for her; she borrowed his books.
But
how could Minta read them?
She dragged them about
the garden, sticking in leaves to mark her place.
   Heaven be praised for it, she thought; taking up her brush again.
[strike]There was[/strike] The problem of space faced her. She had made, with

Her flickering brown line
had left ?on in the middle of her
canvas a shape,
a solid, shapeless, mass; an iceberg; looming, imminent
prominent [strike]right[/strike] unrelated, right there in the middle of the canvas.
[strike]How[/strike] It was to be
seized upon & animated, & given its due weight
touching it at once
supporting it -
depending on
it
& poise, somehow;
[strike]made to live[/strike]
there, in the centre, with all the other
weights & colours somehow depending on it - [strike]she saw her picture[/strike]
[strike]like a cathedral,[/strike] [strike]whose walls:[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]were all[/strike] [strike]all held together with[/strike]

perfectly
[strike]shoring it[/strike] up, until the whole structure, [strike]became[/strike] beautifully poised,

The little ?pleasures & comforts & anxieties of the real world fell from her.
[strike]Here success was not personal, nor fleeting:[/strike] all was done in solitude
with effort & [strike]here directly she took her brush in her hand.[/strike] she
felt face & ?colour & limbs fall from her, shrivelled up; she

that was her feeling. It was an awful effort & risk; &

there were none; yet, inevitably, she herself would read her
fate, much more clearly here ?than; would measure herself
against a rule whose wishes were marked indelibly.
So, with her brush laden she began
to read the precarious
maze, the dance of line & colour, which, as it went daringly
sensitively [strike]with acute[/strike]

intensely than at other times
figures, groups, scenes: went

Nancy saying "What does one send to the Lighthouse?"; the greenish
light on the engraving; the children laughing down the path; Mr.
Ramsay sending Cam back for her cloak: his hand raised as he
passed her - all this seemed [strike]she thought not like the natural[/strike]
[strike]process of living, but symbolical of life. So that had she been able to[/strike]

[strike]seemed to start up like[/strike]

She sat on the beach writing one of those innumerable letters, which

behind Minta who had a hole in her stocking. Now [strike]his eyes[/strike]
itself

It meant
[strike]ruin[/strike]

[strike]As[/strike]
Perhaps it [strike]was true.[/strike]
[strike]In fact,[/strike]
[strike]she believed,[/strike] [strike]the marriage had been at first quite[/strike] There was some

beach all those years ago - [strike]The marriage[/strike] at first had been
successful [strike]at[/strike] first.
There were two little boys.
Then things worked
loose - They came home at [strike]such[/strike] different hours, from different places.
Lily imagined them meeting on the stairs - Minta garish,
wreathed & tinted, about three o'clock in the morning.
[strike]To[/strike]
[strike]finish the picture[/strike] Paul carrying a poker, in case of burglars,
Minta eating a sandwich, in the cadaverous early morning
light on a staircase with holes in the carpet, dusty [strike]she[/strike] [strike]?worn[/strike] littered.
What did they say? Something violent. He was withered,
drawn; she was flamboyant careless.
She ate her sandwich
while he spoke - in a mutter, so as not to wake the children.
That was the sort of thing had happened, she supposed, painting;
This is what we call 'knowing' people, she thought.
This is what we

   [strike]Then again:[/strike] Another incident [strike]struck her,[/strike] came to mind - Paul
saying that he "played chess in coffee houses".

been domestic; His perfect [strike]nose[/strike] profile hardened & stiffened; for he
played chess in coffee houses; & then came home; [strike]& then[/strike] [strike]there was th[/strike]

came after them, singing & put her bare arm round his shoulder;
but she was bored by hares.
   Lately though ([strike]so she[/strike] here was another scene) they were doing
something with a motor car: & from his manner & hers, Lily knew,

with the
children
as if they had told her everything, & both were reticent, that
[strike]something had happened[/strike]. It was all right now. They had entered on
another phase.

& all her beauty, all her being, became at once a little [strike]pointless[/strike]

What can be done for them, then, she?
For a moment she exulted.
Who persisted so obstinately - one could never, even in thought, wrench her
round, in saying

(Suddenly, suffused with reddish light, she saw again

down by Mrs. Ramsay at dinner.

At the same time, [strike]even in the height of the[/strike] roar & the

Mr. Carmichael [strike]?[/strike]
He lay on his chair with his hands clasped
above his paunch, his beard with the yellow stain on it
flowing upon his breast.
He was no longer reading.
He was
gorged & ruminating.
His book had fallen on the grass.
It lay there, giving off a fume of words, of poetry; he seemed
[strike]to lie there breathing in the incense, torpid, half asleep.[/strike]
& he seemed drugged, drowsy.
221
235
She wanted to go straight up to him & say
   "Mr. Carmichael!"
   Then he would look up benevolently. "About Mrs. Ramsay -
about life - about death - about everything in the whole world!
But you couldn't say that to Mr. Carmichael.
You could
say nothing to anybody.

[strike]It was extremely unpleasant.[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] Like all strong feelings, the

[strike]Why had she come all[/strike]
[strike]this way, to be made[/strike] why should she have done it?
Ghost, air,

[strike]Now[/strike]
[strike]it seemed as if Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
[strike]had one only been letting one run a[/strike]
[strike]little to suit her own purposes.[/strike]
She wanted one back.
One came back.
She was only that.
Suddenly [strike]she became the only desirable pe thing[/strike] in life
Then suddenly she asserted herself again, & the empty drawing room steps
& the frill moving & the puppy tumbling on the
terrace
all seemed to

222
237
well
then
[strike]What is your[/strike] [strike]opinion of life on the whole[/strike], Mr. Carmichael?" she would
trying to

say; so she thought look[strike]ing[/strike] at her canvas.
She was actually crying - that is
to say [strike]tears[/strike] both her eyes were full of some
[strike]rath[/strike] hot liquid
which without
disturbing the firmness of her lips, rolled down her cheeks.
But she had
perfect control of herself in every other way.

Why did [strike]they[/strike] acquiesce in [strike]this monstrous state of things[/strike]?
Why don't we do something about it?
Are we fish, [strike]are we[/strike] coal? - are
or
we things that can be packed in barrels & ?rattled/?salted/?sailed across the world
without protest?
She had a wild idea that if she & Mr.
Carmichael [strike]toget[/strike] got up & made some violent display,
the hollow space which the step & the chair & the puppy indicated
would be vanquished.
If they shouted loud enough, Mrs.
Ramsay would come back.
   It was a degrading state to be in, no doubt. [strike]Of[/strike] All extreme states were
that. Of the pain of childbirth a woman had told her that it was
demoralising. No. So this was demoralising - to wish for
anyone so strongly that one's only notion was to stand up &
shout. Stop pain, stop pain, stop pain!
[strike]And[/strike] It was not
meanwhile
love [strike]either;[/strike] for her feeling towards Mrs. Ramsay was [strike]almost[/strike]
[strike]hatred[/strike] - bitter - it
   [strike]Only at last,[/strike] one [strike]can so f[/strike] could so separate into parts this
this bitterness of wanting & this resentment of being made
to want (just as
she was painting too, & marvelling that she did not care a
straw for Mrs. Ramsay being dead) & [strike]half that yes[/strike] partly - yes
it dawned upon her that her feeling was already finding an anditode
(as they used to say dock leaves grew beside nettles) in a a
but later
embracing the
whole character
& being &
world,
a sense, first purely physical, but very lively, of the
of
whole [strike]beauty of that[/strike] [strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike]
&
beauty,
[strike]of[/strike] her serenity, of
the majesty with which
taking her
way among the dead she
had raised & fitted to her
forehead [strike]a[/strike] white flowers in a
crown.
   She had never heard how she had died: only 'suddenly'.
But
223
239
[strike]she had[/strike] but for days afterwards she had seen her, from some
trick of a painters eye perhaps, raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers,
& stepping with her usual quickness [strike]am[/strike] across the fields, among
whose folds, for they were distant & the flowers very dim, she had
vanished. Now Prue & Andrew went with her.
[strike][?][/strike]
Inevitably
wherever she happened to be, were it
London or country,
her eye
then, [strike]clos[/strike] half closing sought in the real world some
counterpart, something to help out her imagination; & found it in
a suggestion
of the fields
of death.

within her mind.
[strike]Thus[/strike] [strike]Now it was the thought of[/strike] Mr.
Ramsay, recalled by a boat.
She thought, that is their boat,
I [strike]suppose.[/strike] It is now in the middle of the bay. They had been gone an
hour & a half.
And again - the weight of her sympathy made
her try to call up the seats & the coil of rope, Cams skirt, James'
tie, Mr. Ramsays beautiful boots.
224
241
No one had seen her [strike]surrender,[/strike] step off her firm strip of board into the
bitter waters which are there, threatening annihilation.
And now slowly the [strike]pan[/strike] pain & the anger [strike]of wanting, of[/strike]
to be recalled
[strike]slack[/strike] [strike]lessened,[/strike] (just as she was pluming her self upon having escaped
sorrow for Mrs. Ramsay [strike]she was[/strike] recalled) lessened; [strike]were[/strike] [strike]created[/strike]
[strike]it seems[/strike] of this anguish left, as [strike]anditot[/strike] antidote, [strike]as a vision[/strike]:
a not only
a
a [strike]sense of[/strike] calm, [strike]?of[/strike] relief from pain, [strike]which[/strike] [strike]a sense of the presence of the[/strike]

a sense of some one there, [strike]in their[/strike] [strike]consoling, whole, escaped;[/strike] [strike]come back,[/strike]

her,
[strike]consoling, & yet not[/strike]
staying a moment, lightly & consolingly beside her,
& then (for this was Mrs. Ramsay herself, in all her beauty) raising to her
forehead a wreath of white flowers, & [strike]so disappearing[/strike] with which she went.
   [For days after she had heard of her death, Lily had seen her, from

   She stepped with her usual quickness across fields among whose
folds, purplish & soft, among whose flowers, [strike]they[/strike] hyacinths, lilies,
she [strike]had[/strike] vanished.
It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days
going
after she had heard of her death, Lily had seen her thus, [strike]stepping,[/strike] with
Sights phrases they ?their

Whereever she happened to be, if it were in London, or in the country,
her eyes, half closing, sought [strike]in the real world[/strike] something to
base her vision on, she looked down the [strike]lane of the[/strike] railway carriage,
at the windows opposite, if it were London; or in the country, at the
curve of the road, at the mass of the hill.
But it always ended
in one way. [strike]There[/strike] Something forced itself on her which she could not

It was a boat.

In it sat Mr.
Ramsay, to whom she had refused her sympathy: & he had
beautiful boots, wonderful boots.

The boat with the brown sails was now half way across the bay.
So fine was the morning [strike]that[/strike] except for a streak of wind here & there, the

the sea & sky looked
[strike]as if they met without any[/strike]

...6...
It was awfully monotonous, & very hot too, [strike]so[/strike] [strike]fl[/strike] flapping about, waiting for a
breeze, miles from shore, & miles from the [strike]Lig[/strike] lighthouse[strike],[/strike]. Sometimes [strike]for[/strike]
the sails sagged [strike]alt[/strike] entirely, & [strike]at once[/strike] you could hear [strike]the waves[/strike]
little waves, though they were right out to sea, [strike]brea[/strike] lapping against the boat; &

Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still The sun beat down.
The boat became full  of squeaks & creaks. Macalister's fishing line
went
The lighthouse
stood still, & the
hills on [strike]the[/strike]
in the distance
plumb down into the sea. & everybody
seemed very close together &
there came a
[?] ?dark
line up
the sea
[strike]quite indifferent to each other,[/strike]
terribly depressed.
Then, almost before the
sail filled, the boat would seem to [strike]be[/strike]
make an effort, [strike]to[/strike]
as if
she were bracing herself together, & sure enough,
almost before
the moment after
she
[strike]would stretch herself out & lie,[/strike] creak & groan & begin to move,
half consciously, as if in her sleep, [strike]acr[/strike] through the water.
The
fishing lines (Cam held one too) would pull her aslant again,
&
the far away hills & the lighthouse would begin bobbing up & down
[strike]again[/strike] as before.
[strike]But nobody had[/strike]
[strike]Everyone[/strike] They all felt much
happier,
but
[strike]nobody said anything.[/strike]
[strike]again,[/strike] [strike]it was ever so long since anybody had spoken.[/strike]
   Suppose that anybody had spoken, half an hour ago, James would have
[strike]almost certainly[/strike] have felt as if a little stick, something finicky &
obtrusive, had been stuck into a stream which was running full tilt
at top speed all one way.
[strike]But nobody had spoken.[/strike]
His father, who was
reading, had turned [strike]the[/strike] a page.
[strike]one[/strike] two or three
That was enough
to give
the
stream a vicious curve.
For it was all about his father; the
or rather,
for
his father [strike]having ceased[/strike] [strike]had long[/strike] [strike]physically had long ceased[/strike]
[strike]to[/strike]
[strike]influence his thought, it was[/strike]
[strike][strike]about his[/strike][/strike]
[strike]&[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]the[/strike]
& when his father turned a page, it seemed
[strike]a very[/strike] sharp as if he turned it
self assertive [strike]way of turning a page,[/strike] an insolent, or insolently,
or
with a desire to ?interfere; or with his usual love of
making himself [strike]conspicuou[/strike] out an object of pity.
Had he, [strike]as well[/strike]
in addition to turning
a
page spoken [strike][?][/strike], surely at last something
would have happened.
He
[strike]James[/strike] always had at the back of his mind
an idea of a dagger which he would plunge into his father's heart.
[strike]But this was half an hour ago.[/strike]
He had always
16
10
[u]7[/u]
£35
NYPL
227
247
He had always had that idea of [strike]plunging something[/strike] [strike]?at[/strike] striking his father,
killing something violently.
Powerless as he was, to strike, to kill was his only
means of [strike]defying tyranny[/strike]
breaking a [strike]hole in the suffocating[/strike]
[strike]barricade[/strike] his way out to the freedom. [strike]Yet[/strike] That there was something
irrational in this [strike]recourse,[/strike] [strike]violent desire, he[/strike] terror, in this demand, he
knew now. He knew now, even at this moment, when he sat with
his hand on the tiller, looking fiercely at his father, [strike]who[/strike] [strike]did nothing[/strike]
[strike]sat absorbed in his book,[/strike]
that the thing he [strike]would kill was[/strike]
wanted to kill was not that man [strike]there[/strike],
the old distinguished man

[strike]but[/strike] who was - strangely -
completely ignorant of any [strike]such[/strike] vice on his part, or any anger on his
son's part. [strike]?H[/strike] It was a thing that descended on him: an [strike]aug[/strike] [strike]?august devil,[/strike] if
[strike]that[/strike] [strike]of[/strike] without his knowing it. A thing that had always descended on
him; that had perched on his shoulders & pecked at them all
when they were children. [strike]His fear was[/strike] And now that he was growing up,
there were times when he could see [strike]himself[/strike] his father [strike]like a ?good[/strike]
like a man haunted by a devil,
But
[strike]He knew[/strike] now that the man himself,
was
who walked about, quite unconscious of it, burdened with this vulture [strike]of[/strike]
[strike]was not[/strike] a thing that descended on him without his knowledge. He was
There was [strike]n[/strike] something consoling in the thought.
His vices were not
himself,

And [strike]wh[/strike] at the same time that he felt this,
The vulture might fly off. might leave him
[strike]There was[/strike] And then they were bound
But [strike]none the less[/strike] when he grew up
he meant to go for it; meant to track it down wherever he found it.
It was a terrible vice - making people do things when they did not
want to do them - interfering with free speech - for how could they say,
I don't want to do this? No one dared say that. [strike]Yet if t[/strike] The
great black vulture whom he felt as a little boy pecking at his
bare legs would have clouted them over the [strike]wings[/strike] head with his
wings.
No doubt his fright was irrational.
He was a
gentle old man, very simple, very austere.
Anyone could speak to him.
Look at him reading there.
Anybody would say, he has no such
thought in his mind.
But, James replied, [strike]as he was[/strike] swept
along by this hot current,
if he says do that, one had to do it
[strike]nobody who[/strike] once feel that tyranny
& you [strike]can[/strike] never forget it.
For he tried to [strike]exc[/strike] make excuses, as he
228
249
steered for the [strike]violence of his own[/strike] feelings - [strike]why, when[/strike]
this. As he grew older he made a very queer kind of excuse. [strike]He said[/strike]
& this he felt more & more, [strike]it is not him I hate, but[/strike] [strike]how he[/strike] for
he was more & more like that sin-haunted man, that man with the
vulture on his shoulder; he
was
like him in all save that: in
bareness & austerity
[strike]&[/strike] in some fanatical quality, in some
[strike]def[/strike] [strike]?giv[/strike] intolerance, & insight: [[strike]he[/strike] only
no vulture should be
allowed to perch on him.]
Further, & this puzzled
him
more & more,

space:

fathers.
set foot precisely there, where he came, & his father came, together.
But further, & this ?turned his clearness, puzzled him always a little,
&
[strike]what[/strike] he hated that man not for what he had done this morning, or last
week, but for some curious terror which he had suffered at his hands
years & years ago. Suppose that as a child his perambulator had
been stood in a field where there was a bull; [strike]for ever after[/strike]
[strike]suppose[/strike] no but that was not quite it. Suppose as a child
he had seen a waggon crush a childs foot - [strike]for ever after one would[/strike]
go in [strike]fear of waggons, & crushing:[/strike]
that was more like it.
A man
waggon
who crushed peoples feet, yet
never knew [strike]it. A[/strike] that he was doing it, &
himself sitting [strike]lit[/strike] helpless
in a perambulator watching - that was
a little
[strike]something[/strike] nearer the
[strike]explan[/strike] nature of his anger & terror & the sense
of helplessness that overcame him, even now, when his father came
striding along the passage, knocking them up, early in the morning, to go to
the Lighthouse.
   But whose foot did he crush? [strike]Where was[/strike] that
[strike]waggon[/strike] going What field? What truth was there in [strike]all[/strike] at
the back of all this? There was [strike]that[/strike] - & here there came before
[strike]him[/strike]
There was that garden.
[strike]A[/strike] that miraculous garden, where
[strike]everything[/strike] [strike]to begin with[/strike] where before the [strike]f[/strike] fall of the world (&
he did really divide time into the space before catastrophe, & the
space after) [strike]all the[/strike] if it was not actual fine weather, at any rate
nobody was gloomy like this: where there were ever so many
people in & out all day long; where there was no dont & do, but
simply commonsense prevailing, & freedom. where - how; he did not know,
all the colours were [strike]of a kind[/strike] of deep, glowing kind: blue bowls; jars of
great burning red - all in confusion, yet order: windows open, blinds
229
251
flapping & in those days yellow awnings had to be spread over the doors to
prevent the paint blistering: bowls held [strike]b[/strike] gold fish: [strike]an air[/strike] through the
warm summer air voices eagerly talking could be heard: shouts of
laughter: [strike]&[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] & then, when night came,
it was
like a very thin veil
drawn over the [strike]light of the sun, still like more very soothinly[/strike]
the [strike]windows[/strike] daylight: it hushed & soothed; [strike]peopl[/strike] it covered
up what
would be glowing there the day after.
   [strike]But[/strike] But the waggon wheel must have gone over a foot there; even then:
Presumably if he were quite honest, he meant his mother.
A waggon that goes over a foot without its being anbodies fault, yet, if you see it done,
sitting up in your perambulator, helpless, [strike]the[/strike] it is [strike]exc[/strike] [strike]pain[/strike] torture:
it is excruciating pain: [strike]Very well. He was now matching it[/strike]

[strike]opening & shutting[/strike]. There it was, noiselessly opening & shutting
it
with the light of the lighthouse coming through, silently, [strike]steadily all night[/strike] long.
[strike]It had been to him a symbol.[/strike] opening its eye, [strike]of[/strike] shutting it, [strike]in time[/strike] [strike]until,[/strike] in a kind of

rhythm, until listening, seeing, the waves, the light, one
[strike]fell asleep.[/strike] [strike]nu[/strike] one fell asleep, but so lightly that all the time one heard

a stark grey funnel on a rock, something like an extinguisher: [strike]there it was[/strike]

[strike]There was a gulf of some sort between[/strike]
[strike]the world before the[/strike]

It was impossible to make the two things

[strike]It became more & more difficult[/strike]
   [strike][/strike][strike]Even there, thinking about the world before the catastrophe, he would[/strike]
[strike]almost forget why he had begun to think of it.[/strike]
[strike]Or, something so ?cut ?as[/strike]

[strike]discrepancy[/strike] [strike]between the two[/strike] & it had come to him through his father - even

It rained, of course, if he said so. [strike]But the curious thing was this:[/strike]

For it rained of course if he said so; but what was [strike]w[/strike] worse,
what was lasting,
was this [strike]lasting[/strike] turn he gave to the
whole nature of things, ?setting
so that for ever after they showed the

The Lighthouse had turned grey & stark.
And this being the [strike]noble[/strike]
was ?founded
on colour; &

The world before the rain
was founded on queer things which one could never seize again.
It [strike]was[/strike] Yet those things [strike]p[/strike] kept ringing, [strike]suddenly[/strike] chiming. Confusion
seemed inevitable: clash, conflict. [strike]Always in[/strike] They would be sitting
And if it [strike]was the[/strike]
What he [strike]pointed out to[/strike]
[strike]And if [?][/strike]
But still
that by no means exhausted what was in his mind about this
wheel going over a persons foot.
When he said "a person" it was
always a sign to himself that he was drawing near that [strike]cur[/strike]
[strike]extraordinary[/strike] that awful ?bore, that thing he never wanted to think about
really, since it was devastating & unnerving & [strike][?][/strike] terrible, terrible
to think of her - his mother, he meant; but sheered off as quick as he could,
[strike]calling her[/strike] refusing to visualise her as clearly as, unfortunately, he was able.
For she could be seen again, unfortunately, by going into certain
little things wh he

rooms, taking hold of certain little [strike]box la[/strike] painted boxes [strike]which[/strike] ?or
used to stand on her table. She could be seen by half listening
sometimes
when Rose talked, in her way,
coming down on [u]this[/u] word, on [u]that[/u]
word; & ending a laugh, with three 'ahs' which always seemed to
[strike]express the essence of joy, like a birds[/strike] last drops of some
of ?people
[strike]ex[/strike] perfect ?happiness wrung out one by one like that - ah, ah, ah.
Now somehow that wheel [strike]had[/strike] ([strike]&[/strike] he looked so ferociously at his
father reading, hunched up, in the middle of the boat: Cam, [strike]first[/strike]

There he was

[strike]quite[/strike] certain that she felt the same horror that [strike]they did, that[/strike]
he & Cam did.
[strike]There was that horrible[/strike] It was some horror
that afflicted them all in the same way: ugliness: noise; violence: but
truth.
And then, when he would have plunged a dagger in his
father's heart, she seemed, after sitting puzzled, for a few minutes, to
have made up her mind.
She [strike]would[/strike] snubbed him fearfully once.
233
257
But his mother somehow got up & went away into the distance, leaving him,
ridiculously;
grasping a paper knife,
impotently
[strike]impotent to do anything[/strike]
& [strike]he could not[/strike]
[strike]follow her, even now[/strike]
where she went & what she felt he could not, even now, 
?tapered off
majestically into the distance
imagine.
She [strike]became suddenly[/strike] remote, & majestic;
[strike]sleepy[/strike]
   Not a breath of wind blew. The boat [strike]was like a very lazy old[/strike]
[strike]animal, stretching,[/strike]
stretched itself for a moment & then relaxed
?alert,
?alone,
slackened. [strike]James felt that his father[/strike] At any moment Mr. Ramsay
might wake up in a [strike]state[/strike] of [strike]great[/strike] [strike]an[/strike] annoyance; &
ed,
a thought which made James think all the more intently &
rigidly [strike]w[/strike] about his mother, as though he were stealing down stairs
in bare feet, afraid of waking a watchdog, with a creaking board.
[strike]what happened when she left him, why she had done it, & what she was like;[/strike]
What was she like then?
[strike]He knew now that the[/strike]
There was that phantom; [strike]but[/strike] whose approach was all set about with
anguish & tears; so that, speaking soberly one must shut that [strike]off,[/strike]
[strike]if one wanted to[/strike] all off, [strike]fo[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] he wished to be very exact. [ When she
[strike]went away,[/strike] why then [strike]sh[/strike] did she marry him?
If they were alone,
what did they talk about? ] He wanted to follow her from room to room,
as she went about unsuspectingly, & at last to find himself alone with her:
& then to put to her question after question. He wanted to
all that

& [?]

garden
[strike]master[/strike] encircle & master [strike]the[/strike] this extraordinary, miraculous
garden: where he kept finding himself, [strike]which kept coming back[/strike] rather
unwittingly.
[strike]yet so seductively[/strike]
[strike]What, then, if she were there now,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]would one feel?[/strike]
[strike]And could one speak to her?[/strike]
[strike]But what could one say, having followed her into some little private room?[/strike]
[strike]At last, one would be able to speak the truth;[/strike]
to speak the truth at last; to have done with these intolerable
evasions. these lies, these subterfuges.
[strike]Nobody[/strike] [strike]Someb[/strike]
He could never be told the truth
The truth was [strike]the[/strike] simplest of all
things.
It might be very unpleasant.
[strike]"Yes, but your books are not[/strike]
[strike]first rate. You are not a great philosopher."[/strike]
[strike]Also it was[/strike]
[strike]amusing. Old Carmichael was, really, a figure of fun.[/strike]
Also
very amusing; very easy, very satisfying.
To her alone,
one could say it that was the source of her everlasting attraction for him -
234
249 
why she had remained all these years, in the background there,
like the answer to some question, which nagged at one.
What was the
use now of asking it? He thought how they lived surrounded by
mists & vapours. All the figures of their landscape were bulging or
dwindling like figures in a crazy looking glass at a fair.
Ask a simple question, But why did she marry him? why, if
his books were bad, could she not say so? & then, these
distorted figures (he had in mind Professors & old women)

that way, until to blunder into the drawing room of a
Sunday afternoon was to feel [strike]ashamed,[/strike]
an insult to them all; to them both; for he had that fibre in him too:
And all this, whatever they might say of her beauty & her goodness,
she would not have tolerated for an instant.
235
251
And [strike]he[/strike] the house grew steadily darker, with things that could not be thrown away.
[strike]Little shrines seemed to[/strike]
& there were shrines [strike]?on[/strike] in corners where
sacred objects accumulated, in ?& with their associations thick upon them,
Then there were lectures;
nights of early dinners, & long
dreary drives in the heart of winter to tabernacles in the
city where his father, standing up very stiff & straight, proved
upright
conclusively (but James could never keep his attention fixed)
how
that [strike]Go[/strike] there is no God; [strike]but[/strike] & rows & rows of the ugliest
sat in rows
ed
people in the world [strike]sat[/strike] gap[strike]ing[/strike] up at him.
James tried to imagine his mother
in a chill
green
hall
he could only see her:
there: she [strike]would[/strike] have twitched
her cloak round her, feeling the cold.
But she was dead by that time.
The war was beginning. Andrew was

Even when his
audiences [strike]had[/strike] did not half fill the hall, & were mostly elderly
women, whose heads rose & fell, like hens sipping, as they listened, &
wrote, & then listened & wrote, still he [strike]p[/strike] lectured. He liked [strike]one[/strike] of his
some
children to go with him.
They had to say something in the cab going
back about it, or he was angry.
But they had none of them anything
[strike]gift for paying compliments.[/strike] to say.
They writhed in their agony.

A great success.
But that
did not satisfy him & the evening ended in an [strike]mort[/strike]

thought of something better to say. But why had they got to go to these

for him.

   [strike]So was James in a sense.[/strike] But James felt always,

about your feelings.
You cannot feel, if you talk as he does.
At the same time he felt,

& the war went on, & there seemed no good in anything,
[strike]a[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] a respect for his father doggedly sticking it out about God &
morals.
Nobody could possibly deny that he had an
236
253
a brai
an extraordinary mind. He found Jasper reading one of his books
& they argued [strike]about[/strike] what it was all about.
But as his father treated him [strike]always[/strike] as if he were a bumpkin & a

whatever in

There was a creature they [strike]once[/strike] had

237
255
Sitting perfectly still in the sun, with the boat rocking, fearing every moment
that his father would look up, he was powerless to flick off [strike]these thoug[/strike]
[strike]this[/strike] these grains of misery: settling on his mind one after another.
[strike]And the sense of coercion would increase:[/strike] a band seemed to tie [strike]to[/strike] him there,
& his father had knotted it, & he could only escape by taking a knife &
plunging it - [strike]Cam, he thought,[/strike] At that very moment, [strike]the boat[/strike]
[strike]shivered,[/strike] & the sail [strike][?][/strike] swung round & filled, & the boat [strike]seemed[/strike]

Sitting upright, [strike]instead of drooping,[/strike] she said the whole poem as far as she
knew it
   [strike]We perished each alone,[/strike]
   But I beneath a rougher sea
   And whelmed in deeper gulfs than thee.
She said to herself; looking at the shore, which faced her, in a sort of amazement
[strike]& feeling[/strike] [strike]b[/strike][strike]Behind their island was another island,[/strike] & [strike]s[/strike]She
was now seeing what she had never seen in her life [strike]she was[/strike]
[strike]Now if anybody[/strike] [strike]Nothing[/strike] could have [strike][?][/strike] excited her more.
[strike]Knowing[/strike] But it seemed to her infinitely strange.
The
Her island which she
idolised [strike]did[/strike] she did not quite know why, privately, - she thought
about it in London, [strike]again[/strike] constantly: she resented other peoples
talking about it - she was furious when people talked about
going there casually, - this place which was theirs, or
really hers, [strike]had an[/strike] was like that. It was only that she was
seeing it from a new angle.
She was seeing it for the first time
It lay like that in the sea, did it; [strike]& it had[/strike]
at [strike]that moment[/strike]
Her fishing line
[strike]went[/strike]
flew out between her fingers.
[strike]The[/strike]
It seemed to

257
now that the boat was moving quickly that she held a hold of something
thrilling with life, a quivering sharp thread, which [strike]connected her[/strike]
[strike]with all[/strike] went down ?in & the ?word both up in the sky & down
there in the water was astonishingly queerly oddly alive & strange,
unreal, this queer morning, when one saw the island for the first time
239
259
He saw Cam looking who had been sunk in a kind of lethargy,
now look up, [strike]rather[/strike] look surprised. She had forgotten all about the contract, he
thought.
[strike]Her[/strike]
This
her
   [strike]This[/strike] island, [strike]their[/strike] island, the island she idolised privately so that it
enraged her when people said they had been to it, was like that then
she thought.
It lay like that on the sea, did it.
It had that great ?boss out
flowed in
there, & then, the sea came [strike]round[/strike] there, [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]It looked completely[/strike]
[strike]different from what[/strike] & went on for miles in a broad
?sweep passage
[strike]glittering[/strike]
to the sky.
[strike]sweep,[/strike] [strike]glittering in[/strike] the sun, as she had never seen it.
[strike]It went on;[/strike]
on & on, out there.
Where then did it go?
It was a very small
island, stuck in a vast spread of sea.
[strike]It seemed to her that they[/strike] were
[strike]adventurers, pirates, people saved from a wreck, & in obedience to[/strike]
[strike]an[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]some queer instinct which lig could made[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]the mo made things[/strike]
[strike]go quickly & gave them an interest, she supposed that they were survivors of a[/strike]
[strike]disaster, & all depended upon her catching a fish;[/strike]
But
automatically
she began to tell herself that they were adventurers, they were a shipwrecked
crew, they had to live on the fish they caught.
[strike]She[/strike]
But at the same time she was aware [strike]of[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] [strike]it was an extrao[/strike]
how this
[strike]Even if she chose to play games,[/strike]
[strike]it was[/strike] an extraordinary occasion.
[strike]A[/strike] The island looked like that; &
She did not know the points of the compass
But she recalled herself with a jerk.
He had been annoyed with her
for not knowing the points of the compass.
But that was
But as if the sea were ?in her mind, & things
fell on the top & were
whirled away, so her father's anger, &
[strike]his[/strike] her [strike]ang[/strike] unhappiness,
at
about not knowing what to say to him [strike]& James[/strike]
[strike]be[/strike] keeping
the compact with James had slipped away in that broad glittering
[strike]path,[/strike] surface; & now a completely [strike]fresh t view had[/strike]
come.
It had changed again.
When would it stop changing?
[strike]Nobody[/strike] [strike]It was like an[/strike] There was one surprise after another.
Whether painful or pleasant, she scarcely knew.
But to be
alive & to be forced,
[strike]for no[/strike] from no will of ones own, to be
oneself, sitting in the
boat looking at that [strike][?][/strike] island was an
astonishing fact,
& her line seemed to flick with an intense
excitement, jerking
& vibrating in her fingers, & increasing [strike]the[/strike] her feeling
240
261
being
That she was [strike]somehow suspended, between[/strike] [strike]alive[/strike] a [strike]lump of matter[/strike]
which
with extraordinary capacities for feeling everything here & now - so that
disagreements & quarrels scarcely mattered [?] & with a future which it
was [strike]almost[/strike] dazzling to contemplate.
All this rushed upon her
when she looked up & saw how the island was shaped: how the sea
which the
shape of the island
seemed to start
flowing
went spreading widely over ?there; & then when this glittering
fountain had spurted up with its insensate joy, she seemed
to catch the falling drops & [strike]to[/strike] with [strike]re[/strike] new zest to apply herself to
all those [strike]unsolv[/strike] familiar half [strike]f[/strike] solved questions which, ?it
she took up at odd intervals & carried a little further; left to
half submerged
half prominent
territories
in her
mind
[strike]wait[/strike] [strike]on her[/strike] alone, & then again explored; how the world had come
into existence; about the ancient civilisations of Egyptians, Greeks & Romans;
the Byzantine Empire; [strike]the[/strike] & then whoever it might be -
Shakespeare, or
the traffic of camels & tribes marching about the
world; their conglomerations in cities, like Athens, Rome, London:
&
how [strike]during these ages, there stood up in the midst of them[/strike]
[strike]the wilds[/strike]
how one thing
followed
another;
then the great men; & then the future; & then her
[strike]father & then[/strike] instinctively she submitted all the questions
?questions
wild, rapid [strike]amb[/strike] heterogeneous
which such thoughts [strike]su[/strike]
stirred in her to his judgment. Silently, of course, without
[strike]being able[/strike] [strike]sayin[/strike] asking him about anything; for
that would have been impossible; but she had often listened to him
saying things
briefly between
puffs of
pipe smoke
talking with old men, like Mr. Carmichael or Mr. Bankes, had
[strike]coll[/strike] made a collection of little odds & ends [strike]which[/strike] they had said
but her father in particular which seemed to her, not [strike]so[/strike]
only [strike]fo[/strike] in themselves, but from the way they were said,
said incontrovertible: It was his handling of things, [strike]Wild[/strike]
fragments of
immortal
knowledge
& [strike]grotesque[/strike] So [strike]she felt[/strike] order was made to come. He walked among
all the incoherent, the wild & tumultuous ideas that come
to her
with a firm half serious tread, neatly brushing them into heaps here &
there, allowing no disorder, & [strike]then[/strike] doing it tidily easily
with complete mastery. [strike]A[/strike] [strike]Then, too, he was[/strike]
While he did this, half seriously, often with that [strike]curt[/strike]
sarcasm which sometimes made her blood boil but sometimes
with rage,
at their
rawness, their
intent to hurt;
seemed to laugh at her own strangeness [strike]la[/strike] rightly, lightly, trimly,
sagaciously, [strike]there was[/strike] he had always about him some

263
of a piece with his grey clothes, & the pipe which he held in the air & put to his lips
with fine clean gestures something level & grey & quiet: so that it seemed
[strike]to her[/strike] to go to him, to sit by him & collect there [strike]qu[/strike] little sayings of his,

was to go into a level [strike]daylit[/strike] day light: to see the whole of her
tumultuous thoughts lit up, steadily & quietly, with a peculiar
sober light - [strike]the sight[/strike] the light that was light itself: & in that,
neither
[strike]all[/strike] satire & harshness [strike]did[/strike] existed, nor temper, nor annoyance, nor
his extraordinary vanity, nor his peremptoriness, nor his tyranny
(she verified each of these qualities by looking at him) but he was

mind in his presence;
for he [strike]made[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] what with his grey clothes & his

an atmosphere [strike]of[/strike] [strike]mixed[/strike] of tobacco &

a grey quiet harmonious exalted atmosphere which she

It was
Unpleasant, pleasant was it? Certainly very exciting.
But
of course it was against James's opinion: how he was a sarcastic brute:
so vain he always brought the talk round to himself; & what was
unforgivable, a tyrant.
Looking at the island, with its
hump & the sea beyond, she [strike]visu[/strike] fixed her mind, [strike]as if to[/strike] answer

[strike]He was[/strike]

There was something wrong in the picture, too. [strike]A line, a[/strike]

how there was nothing for it but to shut ones eyes to that picture for a time,
wait; [strike]miserable[/strike] in such patience
as she could command: trying to
understand
what her problem was.
What was her problem then?
She was trying to get hold of something
which evaded her.
It evaded her - when she thought of the
[strike]view[/strike] picture, & when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay.
Phrases came. Visions came.
But what she wanted
to get hold of
was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been
made anything:
the germ, in painting, in knowing, of all art
&
affection.
Get that again, & start afresh, was all the advice
she could give herself.
But one got nothing by soliciting
urgently.
One got only a glare in the eyes from looking at the
line of the wall, or thinking
Mrs. Ramsay often wore
velvet shoes, & a [strike]shawl.[/strike] green

down at the critical

[strike]capricious, incalculable.[/strike]
The whole machine
gave
out: &
then where was one?
   Well here on the lawn, she thought, kneeling to squeeze out a
a little more grass green, though she did not intend to
[strike]paint any[/strike] paint - only to do a [strike]?litt[/strike] little donkey work at
the corner of the canvas.
Kneeling on the lawn, which,
she
made herself observe,
was rather hard, for it had been on the
whole a dry summer.
There were colonies of plantain
spotting
it
[strike]about[/strike]
which ought to be
killed.

And [strike]then there was Mr.[/strike]
she would have liked to attract Mr. Carmichaels notice
somehow; [strike]or even[/strike] to have rifled his stock of ideas, or
started one of those aimless [strike]pu[/strike] pointless pleasant
conversations [strike]which[/strike] all about nothing.
250
281
[strike]?But[/strike] The old man had become rather famous lately. [strike]His name[/strike]
[strike]verge[/strike] His name [strike]was[/strike] appeared [strike]in papers[/strike] girt about with some romance
in newspapers.
People were beginning to say that Mr. Carmichael who had always been
known to a few enthusiasts, as [strike]one[/strike]
[strike]among[/strike] one
[strike]of[/strike] the finest translators [strike]of[/strike] our literature
in
time: & so on. [strike]He had written also[/strike] a few essays & [strike]some[/strike] a
book of his travels was going to be re-printed.
& in view
of this
[strike]But[/strike] he looked just the same, heavy & slow & benignant.
But she [strike]wo[/strike] could believe it -
[strike]She had liked his leisurelyness; his[/strike]
independence; & [strike]the[/strike] [strike]his one great[/strike]
It was said
that [strike]a[/strike] book he
wrote in the
70s about
traveling in
Burma
was
a masterpiece
He had that quality;
&
[strike]She[/strike]
[strike]knew one curious little[/strike] fact about him:
also this: that he
was true
"had been heart broken at Andrew[strike]s[/strike] death".
Ramsays
The phrase had come
to her casually from some [strike]one[/strike] body who knew him.
They s
in his home. [strike]They said[/strike] ?he thought all the world of him:
of Andrew
She
had a picture of him marching through Trafalgar Square
the day
[strike]the news[/strike] Andrew's name was among the killed, grasping a stick
[strike]with his old hat pulled over his eyes.[/strike]
But he was almost
entirely silent; [strike]or only said n[/strike] [strike]out[/strike] probably never said anything to
[strike]anyone, but let[/strike] certainly never had never said a word of the least
importance to her.
[strike]Yet[/strike]
People handed things round, like this, about
him now. No one had ever heard him say ?them.
[strike]And[/strike] Yet this was one of the important
most
friendships of her life -
[strike]They had never[/strike] [strike]He[/strike] [strike]They had never spoken to each other, but[/strike]
Perhaps they never would say anything.
They would go on eternally passing each other with a sort
of mumble on stairs, sitting side by side on lawns
exchanging views about the train service & the boat service
& the weather.
She had never even read his translation,
except a line or two in quotations; & then she had
recognised the quality she had felt [strike]when he[/strike]
always
something very impersonal &
extremely moving, about
a camel & the desert: something
it was
apparently very simple. but
if she had known anything about writing she would have been
sure that this was the thing that lasted for ever.
something simple but everlastingly strange.

The little [strike]that one knew of people, could be extremely[/strike]

He had the quality [strike]of[/strike] [strike]which[/strike] belongs to those who during a life
of being [strike]a ver[/strike] hospitable to ideas. What one thought about him germinated. Thus, he was a
figure of some humour. [strike]One[/strike] Took opium, never

A
Miserable & inefficient machine, she thought, [strike]this[/strike] [strike]our[/strike] the human

   Here on the lawn, she thought, kneeling on the hard dry turf,

safely in one corner of her picture.

There were several little colonies of
plantain, she observed; & the rooks were swerving about
making black crescents & scimitars [strike]&[/strike] [strike]in the air.[/strike] with their
wings in the air.
   As for old Mr. Carmichael, lying there with his feet on a
campstool, she [strike]wondered about him[/strike] liked to be in his company on
this exalted station (for she could not shake herself free from the
sense that everything [strike]was hap[/strike] this morning was happening
for the first time & the last time; as a traveller, even

that when he heard of Andrew Ramsay's death he had lost all interest in life.
Perhaps he had walked about the streets [strike]holding[/strike] grasping a large stick.

He had walked [strike]about[/strike] the room, he had [strike]drop[/strike] let his pipe fall, he had

She did
not know.
[strike]He had always been[/strike]

They seldom spoke, except about the train service, & the [strike]weather[/strike]

Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly
past the drawingroom window, with a newspaper under his arm,
trying to avoid Mrs. Ramsay, whom, for some reason, he did not
much like?
She would always try to make him stop &
talk. He would bow to her.
He would halt unwittingly &
bow profoundly.
want her
   Annoyed that he [strike]did[/strike] [strike]had[/strike] [strike]did not like[/strike] her, Mrs. Ramsay would
offer all sorts of things: [strike]ask questions: was he[/strike] coats, rugs,
newspapers.
[strike]But it was no good:[/strike] There was some quality in her which
[strike]evidently repelled him.[/strike] he did not like.
He did not like,
perhaps, her masterfulness.
She was so authoritative, so
direct; [strike]&[/strike]
   A [strike]slight[/strike] noise drew her attention to the drawing room window -
the squeak of the [strike]window[/strike] hinge, as the light breeze played on the
window.
   There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily
thought.
There must have been people who thought her
253
289
too sure of herself - too drastic. Then she had no religious beliefs.
Then she
was reserved.
And (to go back to Mr. Carmichael) one could not
imagine her [strike]painting[/strike] standing painting, sitting reading a
whole
morning on the lawn. It was unthinkable.
Without saying a
word to anyone, the only token of her errand a basket on her
arm, she went off, to the
town,
to the poor,

[strike]to some[/strike]

Often & often Lily had seen her go

was of her
own
appearance)

the artichokes for the sun, [strike]makin[/strike] turning her [strike]often[/strike] infallibly to
the human race, making her seek her nest [strike]there[/strike] in its heart.
[strike]Oh no, she could ha not have stood painting[/strike]
[strike]with a[/strike]
[strike]woman dying. And there was always a woman dying.[/strike]
And this was perhaps a little distressing to Mr. Carmichael.
& to herself, too, [strike]of[/strike] secretly.
[strike]To stand painting - to sit reading[/strike]
[strike]while a woman dies a mile off in want -[/strike]
[strike]They both distrusted action? No:[/strike]
[strike]They would[/strike]
Some notion
was in both of them about
the ineffectiveness
of action; the
supremacy of thought. Her going was a reproach
to them; yet
they felt, the care of the world was more truly theirs than hers:
?or they felt, distress at their own impotence to help; or
the usual everlasting sorrow [strike]which dogged the[/strike] of the
safe at the predicament of the insecure.
[strike]In that[/strike]
On the edge of that blue sea, in the ?breast of this moorland, there is the
eternal woman dying in rags.
But
Tansley's contribution
to the
problem
was futile in the extreme.
Except for that brief moment
when he threw ducks & drakes,
[strike]& seemed like other people,[/strike]
[strike]what could[/strike]
& Mrs. Ramsay wrote
letters, what could be more
insufferable [strike]than[/strike]

The one word
"I" - he
repeated it over & over again.
As for his opinions
To her
dying day she would not forget that he paid 2d for his
254
291
tobacco. Increasingly grubby (she had heard him at a meeting) he
was no doubt the most high
principled of them all: slept out [strike]d[/strike] of doors
all the year round;
had no maids.
Incapable of telling a lie, [strike]he[/strike]
Her
own pictures she
believed were more
to the good of the race than his
preaching - though if
they were not painted over, they were given
away shamefacedly, hung in the servants bedroom.

And he had made her realise the [strike]hatred which people have for each other.[/strike]
profound hatred which separates man from man.
(But she [strike]would[/strike] lost this,

Then, [strike]by a[/strike] suddenly the old cork or whatever it was began bobbing up &
down among the waves: & this strident arid [strike]rauco[/strike] [strike]ra[/strike] red faced
man on the platform became an angular boy who with all his
faults put by [strike]out of a scholarship[/strike] his earnings enough to educate a
little sister. Enormously to his credit, said Mrs. Ramsay, looking
for her spectacle case among the pebbles.
Oh dear, what a
nuisance, lost again! -
[strike]Mr. Tansley[/strike] [strike]A thousand thanks[/strike]
Don't bother, Mr. Tansley.

And he let the exaggeration pass.
One must suppose that,

put his chin

collar &

He became a

The vividness of her own sensations, standing there looking
at the

but then, she reflected, one knew
very little about other peoples sensations.
[strike]The fatal barrier[/strike]
There were barriers
between herself & Charles Tansly was this: fatal barrier:
that
he hated pictures,
never looked at a thing.

too much perhaps
It became
impossible,

She did not deny [strike]for a moment[/strike] that he had a brain.
[strike]P[/strike] [strike]Paul Rayley had none.[/strike]

And then the [strike]interpretations one[/strike] wild leaps one made, the

a pause, a tone of voice; some little phrase which was spoken without
any consciousness that [strike]it was the very[/strike] [strike]lifted a curtain &[/strike]

all
meant to her, & the colour & the window: the sound of the

what stirred & trembled when the children cried, cricketing,

[strike]Why did she, after all,[/strike]
And then [strike]how was one to[/strike]
[strike]re[/strike] [strike]capture anything[/strike]
[strike]when he[/strike] Mr. Ramsay passed.
What a trail of curious feeling went through the whole of her,
&
sometimes seemed to rock her in profound agitation
upon its breast; [strike]when he spoke,[/strike] [strike]severely to James;[/strike] or
He had only to speak one word, or once
she
could
remember
[strike]said nothing even;[/strike]
[strike]as if now & again the presence of her[/strike]
[strike]husband was enough to[/strike]
to stoop & give her his hand up out of a

she understood, [strike]with[/strike]

had
thought to herself (adored & courted as she must have been) surely

303
Theres that
yes:

And there would fall between them sometimes long [strike]tense[/strike] rigid
silences. when, in a state of mind which Lily resented for her,
half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount the
tempest [strike]with her usual dignity,[/strike] or to laugh, as they laughed; but
(in a [strike]tacity[/strike]

perhaps concealed something.
[strike]There might be[/strike] she could not

So they would talk as usual. All would be as usual, save only
for some quiver of gaiety? tenderness? in the air which [strike]kept[/strike] went & came
between them as if the usual sight of the family dinner table
taken on a
meaning
had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears &
[strike]the[/strike] plums.
Especially, Lily thought, Mrs. Ramsay kept glancing at her
eldest daughter, Prue,.
She sat in the middle between
brothers & sisters,
always occupied, it seemed, even when she [strike]did nothing[/strike], in seeing that
was still & silent
nothing [strike]suddenly[/strike] happened wrongly.
[strike]She[/strike] [strike]Prue[/strike] must
She
have blamed herself
terribly for that earwig in the milk, Lily thought.
(Oh Lord, oh
Lord, how
did any woman
ever paint a
picture then, she
thought.)
She went
quite white.
She hated
scenes.
And now,
her
mother seemed
to be
[strike]chiding her,[/strike] making it up to her; [strike]&[/strike] assuring
[strike]to[/strike]
her that everything was
all
right now
well a[strike]g[/strike] again; [strike]& from the[/strike] to be promising her
that same
happiness -
She had enjoyed it for less than a year
however.
She had let the flowers fall from the basket -
   For that was how she went, Lily thought, screwing up her eyes
& standing back to [strike]get[/strike] look once more at that
picture; & [strike]her mind[/strike]
with all her faculties in a trance;
feeling very still, & helpless;
& yet her stillness
had an
intense
speed in it
Another [strike]ph[/strike] vision that; forming
the instant she heard of Prue's
death.
She dropped all her flowers,
scattered them & tumbled
in the ?grass

[strike]but[/strike] - How could one
wish to die at [strike]twety[/strike] twenty-five? -
but [strike]gathering her[/strike]
unquestioningly - had she not the faculty of
obedience, [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]in[/strike] to perfection, dignified not submissive? -
[strike]Prue[/strike]
She
went;
Andrew went; [In what fields
did they walk now?
For [strike]all[/strike] they were young.
One didn't imagine that they]
They went.
[strike]But it seemed to her[/strike]
Down fields, across valleys;
white, flower strewn.
That was how she would have painted it.

She imagined the austere hills; & the hoarse waves:
The window at which she was looking was whitened by some
dress behind it; oh & shoved open! - a re-arrangement which
did not greatly matter: & now [strike]someone - w was trailing down, so[/strike] over
[strike]the steps[/strike]
There was some one there.
264
313
[It might be Rose; it might be Nancy; it might be that old woman, whats her
name, finishing her novel;
   Whoever it might be, for Heavens sake let them sit still for
& not come floundering out & talk to her.
Mercifully, whoever it was
[strike]had[/strike] settled down inside;
had settled down, by some stroke of luck,
so
as to throw a shadow there which might be useful.
A shadow was
precisely what she wanted, as it happened.
It drew
things together
It began to look rather as
though
the problem might solve itself:
[strike]she[/strike] could one only keep
on;
looking, looking, without for a second relaxing this still intensity of
emotion, this determination not be [strike]hoodwinked[/strike] [strike]bamboozled[/strike]
not to be
[strike]put off with this or that, but[/strike]
[strike]not to accept[/strike] what the
vile nature of the world proffered; lies & corruption, & the
[strike]Could one only seek intensely enough[/strike] Could one
[strike]Then[/strike] distortion, & insincerity; & all that flummery which
divides us,
now
   Was she not [strike]thinking of[/strike] almost [strike]now[/strike] in their presence?
She did
not need to assure herself that [strike]here[/strike] she [?] ?wished, [strike]more[/strike] quite
clearly t[strike]han ever before;[/strike] [strike]between the[/strike] between
[strike]was[/strike] knew what was before her, & could with a sweep of her
mind [strike]master every detail[/strike] tell the time of day: read the letters on the
back of the book even: she was [strike]not confused[/strike]
She was
[strike]Its[/strike] not confus[strike]ing[/strike]ed
not at all, she assured herself;
she was quite on a
level with ordinary experience; only,
In the presence of [strike]whom? of what?[/strike]
[strike]reality: not indeed[/strike] quite:
something troubled her
something still evaded her; [strike]but[/strike]
It was that perhaps: it was
[strike]And letting[/strike] her brush fall to her side,
she stared
wide
eyed at the drawingroom window where for a moment a
white dress so marvellously imitated [strike]the figure[/strike] she had
[strike]seen there,[/strike] [strike]ten years ago, that she could scarcely[/strike]
seen there, ten
years ago. And
He must see it, he must share it.
She turned
hastily to look
for the boat;
265
315
The white shape moved in the window.
She let her [strike]brush[/strike] arm fall
to her side.
If it was that, & it seemed to her that it was, somehow, Mrs. Ramsay herself,
where then was he?
[strike]Could one press straight on.[/strike]
it in
could one [strike]hold[/strike] the scene in a vice; [strike]without[/strike] [strike]so that[/strike] [strike]steadily,[/strike]
& let nothing [strike]harmful[/strike] from outside enter in.
One wanted to be quite on a
level with ordinary experience. [strike]One wanted to[/strike] feel thats the
chair; &
thats the table: [strike]And yet[/strike] yes: but [strike]also[/strike] [strike]so to seize them that[/strike]
[strike]the extraordinary fact was made clear for the[/strike]
[strike]they're[/strike] themselves as they [strike]have never[/strike] exist
& yet to feel, its a miracle, its [strike]a thing that has never happened before.[/strike]
a [strike]vision.[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] its an [strike]ess[/strike] ecstasy.
Ah but then [strike]most[/strike] The white thing
[strike]what[/strike] unhappily; [strike]for she did not[/strike]
[strike]something[/strike]
[strike]what was this ?[/strike]
[strike]A movement[/strike]
[strike]some trick flaunt or[/strike]
[strike]moved.[/strike] [strike]She must[/strike]
moved - the air
[strike]just[/strike] lifted some flounce: [strike]so that[/strike] her heart leapt out at her
seized her & again tortured her: [strike]with that[/strike]
Oh Mrs. Ramsay! she
cried out, letting her brush fall.
[strike]It seemed as if she were[/strike]
[strike]actually there again[/strike]
[strike]It was the devil, it was the devil to be[/strike]
[strike]thus sucked under, when one had got clear of the whole[/strike]
[strike]horror & terror; to feel the old[/strike]
There she was again; in all her force, [strike]drag[/strike] making one
stop, [strike]even now;[/strike] [strike]seizing one, & letting[/strike] & yet
making one feel again the old triumphant [strike]invincible[/strike] power:
[strike]&[/strike] how one had loved her; [strike]& she[/strike] [strike]And she had gone.[/strike] [strike]There were[/strike]
   [strike]But[/strike] [strike]And for a moment it seemed as if all[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike]as[/strike] [strike]that had[/strike]

[strike]A[/strike]

317
But what was strange was that this familiar horror - to want & to want &
[strike]not to have,[/strike] then ceased. It was as if like the chair, there, Mrs. Ramsay too

had [strike]asked to ?be[/strike] be put on [strike]a[/strike] the level of ordinary experience; & so enjoy her.

quiet & at her

[strike]extremely like[/strike] chair as it happened was exactly as she used to sit in
it) & she knitted without any acute taste, Lily thought, in the
colour of wools;
flicking her wrist so, & so; & the [strike]whole[/strike]
[strike]room[/strike] was filled with that [strike]quiet[/strike] & she smiled, & she seemed to

lit up, [strike]ordinary thought[/strike] it was, [strike]with th[/strike]

thought
of the
chair,
It became a miracle,
it became an ecstasy: - that [strike]she should[/strike] exist. that she had lived,
[strike]And only[/strike] [strike]where[/strike]
It stayed there [strike]this[/strike] before her, while she
painted (for she began again quietly) & grew [strike]in[/strike] until at last,
she began to feel herself impelled again, by some instinct beyond her
to look for what was it, [strike]to be conscious of some[/strike]
for something - or was it some one?
   It was Mr. Ramsay she sought, [going to the edge of the lawn,
[strike]where[/strike] (Mr. Carmichael [strike]actually[/strike] nodded benevolently[strike])[/strike] to
her [strike]as she passed[/strike], feeling in some confusion that she must
somehow get [strike]him[/strike] into communication with him & tell him,
she went past Mr. Carmichael, who nodded benevolently
to the edge of the lawn, & looked out over the sea.

The Lighthouse was now quite close. One could see the windows in the

They were very close to the lighthouse now.
There it loomed up, stark
&
straight, [strike]on its rock[/strike],
glaring white & black
& one could
see the waves, for the wind had
at [strike]the bare [/strike]?centre rock
freshened, breaking in white splinters. Once could see the windows in the
tower, & a little bit of green on the rock.
A man had come out
 &
looked at them through a glass & gone in again:
It was
extraordinary to be able to make out one detail after another
when one had seen the lighthouse looking the same all these years
across the bay. [It was like that then, James thought.]
Behind
the Lighthouse stretching away in a vast grey sweep was the open sea.
It was like that then James thought.
It [strike]was as if he[/strike] had hoped
seemed to
It satisfied him - it confirm[strike]ed[/strike] [strike]him in[/strike] some [strike]suspicion.[/strike]
[strike]What he had expected -[/strike] him in some idea, in some preconception,

with some idea of life [strike]that suited him[/strike]
which lay dormant in him.
at the back of his
mind
He [strike]could[/strike] understand
It was what he had in common with his
father:
   That old man stood [strike]up in[/strike] a ghastly green-grey hall &
went on
telling
people to be good.
And he believed
270
325
that they were all sinking
in a waste of waters.
He liked to think so.
[strike]Sometimes for a moment[/strike] James felt that he alone understood the
[strike]irritation & the[/strike] why he was so violent & so moody & so [strike]ira[/strike]
despondent - it was because the world [strike]had[/strike] was like this - running wild
seas round stark rocks, & people went on saying no: it is
sweet & cloudy & soft.
[But it was hard, & it was bitter, & it was wild;
& for his own part, he thanked goodness he had sixty or seventy
years before him in which to do battle with it.
He would uproot

He didnot want pity or affection or care, or

   It was Greek, Cam thought; some foreign language anyhow.
Greek or Latin probably.
[strike]It was a[/strike] little book with a mottled
cover which he always
slipped into his pocket when he travelled.
He always read when they travelled.
Hours & hours seemed to

have passed. Nobody had spoken for an age. She had been staring up
into the sky [strike]until[/strike]. She had been trying to imagine - what was the world
really like then? [strike]Outside[/strike] In the house were all sorts of
things she knew heart; out here nothing but the sky.
[strike]What was the meaning of things?[/strike]
   The breeze had freshened a bit too much, Macalister said.

Cam thought. She had played every sort of game, she had
[strike]how[/strike]
imagined that they were shipwrecked: [strike]that[/strike] the mackerel
what the mackerel felt, drawn up there to die: she had
thought of her own bait sweeping white through the waves; how
the fish passed it. & the drowned men whirling down to the sand;
& the sand itself; & the roots of the coast, & how ?the

[strike]It was[/strike] For this reason:

there was nothing in the world except this - a little finger would
do to represent it - & [strike]the[/strike] her father said
"[strike]Youd shan't move[/strike] it."
No. you shant. & one had to hold it still. And
The blind ungovernable rage had possessed her. [strike]She loo[/strike]

it would have pleased him
more than
anything if his father had

It was like that then, James thought. The sight confirmed him in some
notion of his, some latent idea [strike]which it pleased him to have[/strike]
some obscure
sense [strike]that he[/strike]
of his own
character;
& the nature of things
about himself, about the world, which it pleased him to find come true. -
[strike]He had, then, been right then in supposing that the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][strike]yet what could it be?[/strike][/strike]
[strike][strike]That he had[/strike][/strike]
[strike]The[/strike]
[strike]There was a vast sweep of waters, & here & there a solitary rock. [/strike]
He alone, he thought, [strike]had tha[/strike] of all of them shared this
this suspicion
as to the
true
nature of things
this nature, this belief, with his father.
The
old ladies [strike]said,[/strike]
went chivying the ?sun about on the lawn; Mrs. Beckwith
[strike]wa[/strike] for example; & they said how charming & how sweet & how nice & all
that: & D'ya remember your mother?
Whereas, as a matter of fact,
thought James,
the world is like this:
[strike]wild & desolate;[/strike]
[strike]That was[/strike]
[strike]what his father knew too.[/strike]
[strike]He looked at[/strike] the lighthouse,
[strike]standing black & white on its rock, with the sea spreading endlessly[/strike]
[strike]beyond it.[/strike]
That [strike]wha[/strike] was what his father knew too.
The sea goes away endlessly over there; it is grey, [strike]even[/strike] in spite
of the sun even;
He looked at the Lighthouse & the sea beyond;
[strike]but only[/strike]
[strike]His father knew it too. It was the[/strike]
His father [strike]went further.[/strike] He thought
"We are driving before a gale - We [strike]are[/strike]
[strike]doo[/strike] bound to sink.
He looked at reading
His father [strike]read, with his legs curled round each[/strike]
He read steadily.
other.
The book
[strike]That he w[/strike]
   It was Greek, Cam thought, Latin or Greek. He always read
that book on a journey.
And he seemed to have been reading for
hours & hours now.
Nobody had spoken for an age.
She had looked up into the sky;
One cloud moved very slowly.
She had gazed down
into the sea.
Little bits of black cork
floated past.
She had imagined [strike]them[/strike] dying, like these fish,
beating their tails up & down in a pool of water on the
bottom of the boat;
She had imagined the drowning
329
men swirling round & round; & the roots of the shore, [strike]incessantly[/strike]
[strike]washed incessantly, & ris[/strike]
miles beneath, & then rising
into
clumps of trees, houses, gardens, flowers, above.
She [strike]tho[/strike] had thought too
about
tyranny & the compact to resist tyranny to the death.
Wagging her little finger to & fro in the gunwale
she acted the effort of her

grasped her little finger tight [strike]w[/strike] with her whole hand: she had thought of her father ?say

He said "I shall expect you to be
ready [strike]at[/strike] eight o'clock to come to the Lighthouse.
to start
[strike]Yes, but what was he reading, she wondered?[/strike]
He read on, without moving. [strike]He was imperturbable.[/strike]
He submitted

scrutiny
He would

thus that he
escaped, [strike]for[/strike] she thought, by reason of his great nose, & his great
forehead, & the little mottled book he held, in his hand with the
signet ring. He escaped her. You had your hands on him.
And then, like a bird, he spread his wings, & floated serenely
off to settle, out of reach, on a desolate stump.
The breeze had freshened a bit too much, Macalister said.
[strike]It was[/strike] They must keep he head well up to the North he said;
[strike]But James[/strike]
It
was doing [strike]very[/strike] well, he was doing very nicely indeed. It was
keeping he very steady, he said

But did his father hear that, James wondered?
For though he could never remember a time when he had not felt,
For goodness sake don't stop (suppose his father were walking up
down the terrace, for instance, & he were playing on the step)
(it was
something
to
he had felt it
[strike]wh[/strike] just
now, about
the sea &
the lighthouse)
he had always felt too [strike]that[/strike]
Al the same,
I know
that too;

[strike]what he had felt[/strike]
[strike]just now about[/strike]
It [strike]was something to do with[/strike] the sea & the lighthouse:
[strike]some[/strike]
[strike]So that it suppose his father[/strike]
in virtue of which knowledge,
[strike]his father's praise, or if[/strike] his father had praised
him, or even heard Macalister praising him, he would have been
331
pleased.
But damn it all, he read.
One
He escaped [strike]always,[/strike] Cam thought.
[strike]She[/strike] might be blind with rage: (she held her
little finger tight to recall the agony, the suffocation, of his tyranny:
Do this: do that. I won't have this. Obey me instantly: & so on,)
& [strike]suddenly, it seemed[/strike] [strike]he co[/strike] [strike]just as ones hands closed[/strike]
& then, [strike]at the crisis,[/strike] ready to strike him dead as one was, [strike]off he[/strike]
[strike]it was[/strike] impossible.
[strike]Turning[/strike] [strike]She remembered[/strike]
[strike]once[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] his coming into the
[strike]room[/strike]
He stooped, she remembered,
he
picked a yellow flower.
And
her mother,
taking it with an odd little cry stuck it in her dress; [strike]instantly[/strike]
She [strike]had[/strike] let him go, [strike]too[/strike]
then
Yet it was the same sort of [strike]scene[/strike] thing precisely:
He [strike]escaped her: always, even then[/strike]
It was the same even then.
[strike]He had his little perch, out at sea, she thought,[/strike]
smiling, as she
[strike]did, son when sometimes, she came close, imagined herself his[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]very like her mother:[/strike]
333
[strike]Her cry was mixed as she remembered it - as if she[/strike]
[strike]She could not grapple with the[/strike]
It was made [strike]up[/strike] of [strike]so[/strike] amusement & some [strike]grief[/strike] despair,
thing like
the
[strike]that[/strike] little cry [strike]that[/strike] as
Cam remembered it
But it ended with
three [strike]little[/strike] drops of
[strike]pure pleasure.[/strike]
pleasure -
[strike]She also remembered,[/strike]
& the [strike]two[/strike]
Ah - ah ah. That she remembered.
for [strike]the[/strike] pure pleasure in the
sound of this.
[strike]She also remembered &[/strike] often the
two [strike]memories[/strike]
The
[strike]That[/strike] memory would [strike]join the[/strike]

something blue, pendant, swinging:

She saw the finger

which the island had shrunk.
It was sharp & thin &
[strike]fragile,[/strike] something like [strike]the[/strike]

That extraordinary
intricacy;

she thought, was that vast depth, blue, thickly

thought, [strike]seeing how,[/strike] watching how [strike]he brushed[/strike] his father
brushed aside the sail, when, in tacking, [strike][?][/strike] it [strike]knocked[/strike]
the brim of his hat.
His hands seemed to be appointed
335
without any consciousness on the part of the brain, [strike]to brush aside[/strike]
to see that nothing attacked him.
Yes. The hat was a nuisance. The
left hand [strike]put it on[/strike] snatched it off. There he sat, bareheaded,
with the wind blowing his hair about, & his head against the brown
[strike]sail - a head which looked[/strike] of the sail. [strike]A very, very[/strike] He looked immensely old,
James thought. He looked
as if
[strike]as if he had[/strike] done with all this.
[strike]James rememb considered how he was had forty or fifty or even sixty[/strike]
[strike]years of life before him: how he would land, & it seemed to him[/strike]
[strike]that he would ?Ja land on the Lighthouse & go on, but his father would land,[/strike]
[strike]& it would[/strike]
It was all done unconsciously automatically.
He looked as though nothing could reach him, or touch him; as though he had
[strike]embodied now that[/strike] become the very thing that had lain on the outskirts of
James's
mind since
he was a child; had become the

begin then to

that wasn't quite right either. (For [strike]now he was[/strike] the sea

& yet, he looked a little different from that; he looked as if he had
had a sight of something.
Could there be land there?
He [strike]read[/strike]
went on reading
He turned the page - everything he did was full of
signs of his temper - swiftly now.
It looked as if
He was eager, [strike]it too[/strike]
to
get to the end of [strike]the section;[/strike] it
[strike]He read.[/strike] His mind
seemed to be speeding [strike]a[/strike] up & down, up & down, first

   Suddenly he shut the book with a bang, as if to say,

the change startled them.

it seemed as if

So
[strike]They were tied with thread,[/strike]

That was what he meant.
He gave to each of them a packet
tied up with ordinary sewing cotton, Cam noticed. for she felt that she
was so excited that she would notice everything now: [strike]every[/strike]

because it [strike]was so strange;[/strike]

Macalister was clapping his hands on his
thighs:

[strike]had any right to the remark thought James[/strike]
[strike]It was almost[/strike]
[strike]impossible that they should even speak directly to each other.[/strike]
That then was the praise at last! [strike]spoken[/strike]
That was James's praise. That belonged entirely to him, Cam said to herself.
The blood mounted steadily over James's face; he looked like a little boy of
ten. [strike]He looked[/strike] rather sulky, saying to himself that he would not show
that he was pleased; he would make out that he was angry.

Mr. Ramsay [strike]still[/strike] seemed to be calculating the time.
He had his

at the watch.

He seemed Cam thought to [strike]be saying[/strike] have made some bet; about the time it would
take them. He measured the space still left to sail with his eye.
[strike]And then, he shut his watch; put it back into his pocket, & looked[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]to at the island, searchingly, sadly.[/strike]
   With his watch still in his hand, he looked at the island. He sought
with his
[strike][?][/strike] [strike]keen long sighted eyes[/strike] for the dwindled leaflike shape which [strike]Cam[/strike]
[strike]had her eyes on too.[/strike] now appeared far away on a golden plate in the
middle of the sea.
What was he thinking now? she wondered. What could
What was it he sought so fixedly, so intently that [strike]she[/strike] it was painful to
staring
&

[strike]look at[/strike] him?

[strike]She[/strike] They felt both of them,

[strike]we[/strike] Let us give you
everything - [strike]As only[/strike] ask us.
[strike]Dont[/strike] let us

We thought:

They both felt, Let us help you.
But he looked at the blue frail
shape,
which seemed to [strike]made of some[/strike] [strike]vapour burning[/strike] &
thing that had burnt itself to vapour. &
[strike]soon[/strike] it was quite clear,
they did not know what he
No; he did not want anything. He did not ask anything.

He would never tell anyone what he looked for, or
what, perhaps,
as he sat
between them, with his hat off & his head exposed, he saw there.

   [strike]There are[/strike] the parcels, he reminded them, speaking so quietly that it

James as if he were saying
"There is no God", & Cam
thought, "As if he were leading us [strike]upon some[/strike]
[strike]there onto[/strike] that rock" &
& they both rose to follow him as he sprang, holding his parcels,
on to the rock.

[strike]It was[/strike] finished, she felt.
It was finished.
Surging up, [strike]like a[/strike] [strike]from weeds, reeds & mud,[/strike] like a river God, he seemed so
from weeds & mud
[strike]shaggy, so huge, & so benevolent,[/strike] old Mr. Carmichael stood [strike]by her side.[/strike]
beside her.
   "They [strike]will have landed[/strike]" he said.
The image stuck to him. [strike]H[/strike] Like an old Pagan god, shaggy with the weeds
[strike]of the[/strike] in his hair, & his hand
grasping a staff (but it was only [strike]his[/strike] a
French novel) he rose on the edge of the lawn, [strike]sw[/strike] swaying a
little in his bulk [strike]& his benevolence, &[/strike] & said,
raising his hand over his eyes,
   They will have landed.
He was enormously tolerant [strike]of human weakness,[/strike] she felt, [strike]&[/strike]
He spread his hand over all their
weakness
[strike]weaknesses[/strike] [strike]infirmities[/strike]
&
sufferings. He had let knowledge
ooze into him, drop by drop,
till he was steeped in it
There he stood, she felt,
crowning the occasion [strike]without[/strike] [strike]so that[/strike] [strike]as if he had[/strike]

silence, as if she had seen him

It was only a sketch
It was one of those pictures that would be hung in the bedrooms, & then in
the attics; or it would be destroyed.
Very likely, she thought, but it did not
[strike]matter - what was the expression two pins? Two straws? -[/strike]
[strike]She stepped took up her brush. She looked at her sketch, which was[/strike][strike][/strike]

[strike][/strike][strike]That was it. A It was that (she drew a line) which solved her[/strike]

   [strike]Mr. Carmichael was standing at her elbow.[/strike]
[strike]He looked at the canvas - He looked at the step.[/strike]
[strike]He watched her make the line mark which noted for her own eye the[/strike]
[strike]solution of the problem.[/strike]
But what did that matter?

She looked at the
