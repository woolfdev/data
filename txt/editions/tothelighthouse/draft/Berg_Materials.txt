The plan of this book is roughly that it shall consist of three parts:
one, Mrs. Ramsay (?) sitting at the window: while Mr. R walks up &
down in the dusk: the idea being that there shall be curves of
conversation or reflection or description or in fact anything, modulated
by his appearance & disappearance at the window: gradually it
shall grow later; the child shall
go to bed;
the engaged couple shall
appear: But this is all to be
filled up as richly and variously as
possible. My aim being
shall be less emphatic & intense
than that in Mrs. D: an everyday
sentence for carrying on the narrative easily.
The theme of the
1st
part shall [u]really[/u] contribute
to Mrs. R's 
character; at least
Mrs. R's character shall be
displayed, but finally [strike]with[/strike] in
conjunction with his, so
that one gets an impression
of their
relationship
To precipitate feeling, there should be a sense of waiting, of expectation:
the
child
waiting to go to the Lighthouse: the woman awaiting the 
the return of the
couple.
The passing of time. I am not sure how this is to be given: an
interesting experiment, [strike]showi[/strike] giving the sense of 10 years passing.
This is the voyage to the Lighthouse.
Several characters can be brought in: the young atheist, the old
gentleman: the lovers: Episodes can be written on woman's
beauty; on truth:
but
these should be greater & less knobbly
then
those in Mrs. D: making a more harmonious whole,
There need be no specification of date.
Whether this will be long or short, I do not know. The dominating
impression
is to be of Mrs. R's character.

[strike]This[/strike] the idea has grown in the interval
since I wrote the beginning. [strike]It[/strike] The presence of the 8
children, undifferentiated, should be important to
bring out the sense of life in opposition to fate -
i.e. waves, lighthouse. Then there is to be
some [strike]specif[/strike] movement as the evening passes: a
great dinner scene, all the family, & [u]after[/u] this I
think, Minta & Charles go out to become engaged
Also a scene in Mrs. Rs. bedroom, with children
choosing jewels while the birds rise & fall outside;
a scene of her descending the stairs, smelling burning fat;
but all is to draw in towards the end, & leave
the two alone: she expecting the return of the
young couple. That poetry should be used in
[?] quotations to give the character.
I observe today that I am writing exactly oppositely from my
other books: very loosely at first; not tight at first; & shall
have to tighten finally, instead of loosening
as always before. Also at

   "If it's a fine day tomorrow" said Mrs. Ramsay. "But you'll
have to be up with the lark," she added.
[strike]her[/strike] these
To her son [strike]these[/strike] words conveyed an extraordinary impression of
joy. It seemed [strike]indeed[/strike] as if it were now settled, & the expedition
to [strike]which he[/strike] [strike]with all its[/strike] certain to take place, & [strike]the[/strike]
the wonders to which he had looked forward [strike]the[/strike] [strike]br[/strike] [strike]brought[/strike] within touch
with
[strike]so near only a night & a sail[/strike] only a dazzling, uneasy
pains
disquietude, [strike]a glittering[/strike] a nights, & then a day's sail, between.
Since he belonged [strike]to the[/strike] even at the age of six to that great
clan which cannot keep its emotions within separate
compartments, but must let future prospects, & their
joy or sorrow, colour [strike]th[/strike] what is [strike]bec[/strike] [strike]go[/strike] actually on hand,

people, even in earliest childhood, [strike]the[/strike] a joy or a sorrow

power to crystallise or transfix any moment, upon which its
gloom or radiance alights James Ramsay, sitting on the
floor, cutting out pictures from the Catalogue of the Army &
enbalmed
Navy Stores, [strike]endowed[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] [strike]phot[/strike] [strike]refrigerat[/strike] the picture of a
refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly [strike]tenderness.[/strike]

[strike]sounds[/strike], [strike]pop[/strike] the sound of the poplar trees, leaves whitening

in his mind; [strike]&[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] had already his private code
[strike]of[/strike] his [strike]language which is[/strike] own language, & though
[strike]it would have been[/strike] to look at, [strike]in his[/strike] he appeared
the [strike]im[/strike] picture of stark & uncompromising severity.
so that his mother imagined him playing a man's part in
11
[strike]some crisis of public affairs, he was at the moment expanding &[/strike]
[strike]contracting, contracting & expanding like the mainspring of a watch[/strike]
[strike]with joy.[/strike]
   "But" said Mr. Ramsay, stopping in front of the window,
it won't be fine."
   If there had been a knife handy, or any sharp implement
which could have gashed his father's breast & [strike]l[/strike][strike]et[/strike] killed him where he
there and then
stood, James would have seized it. [strike]He hated him, loathed him[/strike]
[strike]from the depths of his heart.[/strike] Mr. Ramsay excited extremes of
such
emotion, [strike]he spoke the truth;[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] for he said what was disagreeable; he 
but then
[strike]said what was true. His[/strike] but it was true [strike]what he said[/strike]. He was
incapable of [strike]altering[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] tampering with any fact, of altering
any [strike]thing which[/strike] truth, to suit the pleasure or convenience of
any mortal being, least of all his own children, of the male sex in particular,
who should be [strike]impervious to such[/strike] from childhood made aware
[strike]of the[/strike] that life is hard, [strike]life is[/strike] truth [strike]is[/strike] uncompromising, & the
passage to that fabled land, where according to Mr. Ramsay
our brightest hopes are extinguished, & our little barks
founder in the darkness, is one that needs, above all, [strike]courage,[/strike] fortitude,
truth
[strike]&[/strike] [strike]strength[/strike], & the power to endure.
   "But it may be fine" said Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]turning some[/strike]
making some little adjustment of [?on] the stocking she was knitting

tomorrow, was to [strike]be put in the[/strike][strike] b[/strike] given to the men.

How would you like to see
the same dreary waves breaking all day long?
& it would be much
worse in winter, when [strike]there were[/strike] storms, & sea birds
dashed against
the window, & the [strike]lit[/strike] little tower was covered with spray, & the
wind was so high that they couldn't even put their noses out of
doors without being blown [strike]away?[/strike] off into the sea?
Putting up his

   "[strike]Now[/strike] the wind [strike]has changed to the[/strike] is almost

The little atheist
was without
Mr. Ramsay's

Everybody in the house made

[strike]the[/strike] Mr. & Mrs.

but
Ramsay, for being [strike]so[/strike] disagreeable,
[strike]&[/strike] [strike]yet[/strike] by no means

Lucy mocked
at him; [strike]for[/strike]

&
Roger mocked at him;
Miss Doyle, Mr. Holcroft mocked at him; Patcham &
Mildred, & Silas, [strike]all[/strike] mocked at him; even old Badger without a

   But this was [strike]being[/strike] [strike]simply rude, &[/strike] simple silliness, said Mrs.
Ramsay.
   Sara Ramsay could be far too severe.

For, apart from the fact that they [strike]were in the[/strike] were not in the Hebrides,
but in the Isles of Skye, apart from the exaggeration ^ Mrs. Ramsay much
[strike]particularly[/strike] disliked incivility to her guests [strike]on[/strike]
particularly if they were rather humble rather [strike]unattractive[/strike] young

men, on the part of her daughter. All young men, [strike]according to[/strike]
had claims upon her. It might be said indeed that she had taken
the whole of the opposite sex under her protection; [strike]& that[/strike] for reasons
which she was incapable of explaining or realising, for reasons which
had [strike]no[/strike] their birth not in her own lifetime, but in her mothers, &
even her grandmothers, [strike]so that for reasons which were[/strike]
[strike]apart from[/strike] [strike]Apart from these reasons, they[/strike] for their

[strike]could deny them those achievements; & the if in[/strike] [strike]But[/strike]
all [strike]this gave them a claim upon her[/strike] for an attitude

towards herself which surely [strike]any[/strike] [strike]needed no[/strike] anyone could [strike]understand[/strike]

woe betide the girl who did not feel it, & respect it - So

never think worth considering any [strike]timid, half hearted way of life,[/strike] or
or
evasion, [strike]any[/strike] failure[strike], or[/strike] to fulfil duties; - & here the severity of her face,
increased; [strike]to such a degree that[/strike] She was then formidable to
behold; & it was only in silence that her daughters - Rose, Lucy, Prue -
could sport with those infidel ideas [strike]of[/strike] which certainly they had
brewed for themselves, of a life far lonelier than hers, & less
strict, of a life, Prue thought, on an island among sea birds, or
Rose thought, not on an island, but in Paris with painters; &
with
Lucy being the youngest, [strike]& scarcely[/strike] print petticoats scarcely
below her knee, thought just a life - but in all their
a life
new
minds was the same constant questioning of [strike]all this[/strike] beautiful,
manly-womanly relationship, its deference & chivalry,
humility charity, Bank of England & Empire of India elements,
[strike]which were[/strike] its flowing skirts & white hands [strike][?][/strike] though to them all
there was something even in this of the essence of beauty; something
which called out the masculine element in all their girlish
hearts & made them, as they sat beneath their mothers
eyes, worship her strange severity, her [strike]sim[/strike] exaggerated
nobility, her extreme & lovely courtesy, [strike]as of a[/strike] a Queen's,
like
[strike]to the[/strike] [strike]who holds out her foot to be[/strike] washes a beggar's foot,
to the [strike]atheist Tansley. Moreover, there was[/strike]
this wretched little man who had chased them, speaking
accurately to the Isles of Skye.
For there could be no two opinions: he was surely
19
   For there could be no two opinions about Charles Tansley: he was a
miserable specimen. When he took his coat off to play cricket he
was all humps & hollows;
[strike]but what he liked best was[/strike] [strike]& he joked so[/strike]
Then one could hear
him
he walked
ever
walking up &
joked
sarcastically
[strike]stiffly, &[/strike] he poked & shuffled;
[strike]what he liked best[/strike] was
forever
forever
down with Mr. Ramsay, &
saying who had won this & that,
who was
[strike]the[/strike] a 'first rate man'
[strike]at this or that,[/strike]
who was 'brilliant but
fundamentally unsound' who [strike],[/strike] was the ablest [strike]the[/strike] fellow in
Balliol, who had buried his light temporarily, at Bristol or
Bedford, but was bound to be heard of later when [strike]some[/strike]
his Prolegomena, of which Mr. Tansley had read the first
pages
[strike]chapters[/strike] in
proof, [strike]saw the light[/strike] were[strike] finally delivered[/strike] - to
branch of
interest
not
day. [strike]His most serious shortcoming, however,[/strike] It might be true
that the great universities of England & Scotland were [strike]institutions[/strike]
lamps [strike]of[/strike] which in all ages had attracted to themselves the
finest spirits, plants of light, [strike]which[/strike] like the wax white
bell shaped flowers in the [strike]gard[/strike] garden
of
clarity &
luminous, stately
dignity
when all
was thorn & thistle round them.
Nobody had a word to say
or universities in the abstract
against learning as such. Mr. Ramsay himself always
impressed, however he might annoy,
by a [strike]purity,[/strike]
&
[strike]an[/strike] integrity
which was that of ivory or bone from which all superfluity [strike]or[/strike]
the daily dropping fine
had been eaten away by [strike]the[/strike] some caustic; [strike]dropped day by day,[/strike]
no
But Charles Tansley, [strike]was not that;[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley,[/strike] [strike]having[/strike]
[strike]learnt all the parrot phrases of learning, its repeated[/strike]
simply what he had picked up;                                     He might
could
repeat; [strike]word for word, all the[/strike] [strike]sad disillu[/strike] [strike]authorative[/strike]
[strike]denunciations[/strike] [strike]m[/strike] [strike]of[/strike] he could deny; he could correct; he
could purse his lips up when Mrs. Ramsay who was herself given to
picturesque exaggerations, spoke of waves "mountains high"
& of everyone "drenched to the skin, & say certainly it had been
a little rough, & his overcoat was wet but not right through;
but when it came to adding something, to giving himself away, so to
speak, to being not merely a repetition - but there, whoever it

was of Mrs. Ramsay's seven children that was trying to explain what was
lacking in Charles Tansley, petered out dismally & fell an easy
now
prey to whoever wanted to talk about something else.
She fell an easy prey, for how could one [strike]give[/strike] [strike]find[/strike] reasonably explain
that when she said she detested him, something [strike]almost[/strike] so remote as to
at
be almost ungetable, so irrational as to be ridiculous could one
get at it, came to her mind, or rather presented itself before her in a
series of [strike]litt actions[/strike] - things he did - [strike]judgments[/strike], or judgments upon
wh
he pressed
(his shufflings his
grunts his
subjects of which she knew nothing, like architecture or cookery, which
so offended her that had she been either cook or architect [strike]had[/strike]
?
she practised any art which fell beneath his notice, there
would have been[strike] such deathly chilliness such an antipathy would[/strike]
the
[strike]have risen between them,[/strike] [strike]nothing[/strike] [strike]for[/strike] it but fight. [strike]Such[/strike]
It was strange
[strike]souls were damned;[/strike] [strike]cut[/strike] off, in this indescribable way by
He was cut

something not much more emphatic than a cough, or a
mannerism, from all share in [strike]natural[/strike] human life,
condemned for ever to remain, like these [strike]ab[/strike] [strike]brilli[/strike] able Jones',
brilliant but [strike]fundamentally unsound[/strike] Smiths, college dons,
[strike]teachers, vociferators, men who could never be[/strike] admitted to
or
[strike]little men,[/strike] little miseries; & yet it was perfectly true, what William
said, that he got on very well with Mr. Ramsay [strike]It[/strike] [strike]Nobody said he[/strike]
[strike]was stupid; it[/strike] He was no fool. [strike]&[/strike] But why Mrs.
Ramsay [strike]so w[/strike] was so annoyed if they laughed at him,
Mr. Ramsay
just because [strike]he[/strike] liked talking to him? But what reason was that?
23
   Then he could [strike]li[/strike] lift his eyebrows & sneer; he could "suspect a
& all the rest of it
little sentimental humbug" [strike]with the best[/strike] of them. When Mrs.
Ramsay, herself inclined to exaggeration, spoke of waves "mountains
high" of everyone "drenched to the skin", he would say
"certainly it had been a little rough", & his overcoat was "damp, but
not wet through". - He would change his socks - that was all.
But when it came to explaining how it was not this that one
objected to [strike]in[/strike] [strike]the [?] little atheist,[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] one did not mind
one was

how

[strike]sentiments which[/strike] but objected to [strike]his ugliness,[/strike] something
all over
diffused [strike]& universal[/strike] in him - his essence, in short - then it
became more difficult, &, short of allowing the conversation to be
changed, it was necessary to lodge a more definite complaint -
for example
was [strike]what one called[/strike]
simply
was
to the effect [strike]for example[/strike] that he [strike]protested[/strike] was a prig.
But a prig? - [strike]what is[/strike] that? [strike]Give him[/strike] Some one who had no
of his own
and had
anyhow
[strike]natural[/strike] [strike]easy[/strike] feelings, [strike]but had to fake[/strike] them. Observe him when
they talked about anything interesting - not facts, or history, of
course, for there he was in his element. But [strike]suppose[/strike]
pictures or poetry; or whether it was not [strike]so[/strike] the loveliest
in the world
seen
evening there had ever been? Then, [strike]how[/strike] no crab on dry
arid

land showed more angular & [strike]uneasy[/strike] & until he had thought of
[strike]which did not[/strike] something to say which had no bearing upon
the subject, but if you examined into it, merely asserted his own
virtue
[strike]virtue,[/strike] [strike]for he[/strike] [strike]Claim[/strike] [strike]right to his[/strike] [strike]his right to[/strike] be [strike]a plain man,[/strike]
[strike]some one who did not like mere beau[/strike] (that he [strike]was[/strike] for the [strike]same[/strike]

rather liked books to have a meaning, pictures to be like something;
& was very [strike]plain and[/strike] that you could not expect ?[strike]the[/strike] working

people to enjoy beauty until they were certain of a nights

he was [strike]very like a little crab, blind, discomfited.[/strike]
Until he had given the conversation a little flick, & made it

[strike]somehow[/strike] bear witness to the struggles which he had been through himself, &
the sense he had of [strike]suffering,[/strike] disorder, & social injustice, which
no fine evenings or fine[strike] ph[/strike] phrases could remedy, he was, like a
crab, [strike]puzzled, irritated, out of[/strike] set on a table, turning this way & that,

have liked him better if he had not told her this & been [strike]so[/strike]
conscious of it, & dwelt upon his poverty - [strike]but[/strike] when Mrs.

& all round it, fading & falling, low, desolate [strike]grey like[/strike] with sand dunes &
green with [strike]gr[/strike] wild flowing grasses which even across the water seemed
to be running away into silence, into wildness, into some eternal
[strike]eternal[/strike]
communion of their own, [strike]with[/strike]
[strike]silent[/strike] unimparted, with the
sky & the sea.
It was this view that her husband loved;

His picture, like almost all [strike]that[/strike] painted [strike]there[/strike] in
the island; [strike]was a little spectral.[/strike] Since the visit of Mr. Pauncefort
three years ago, was a [strike]little[/strike] green & grey with a lemon coloured boat & a
[strike]distant[/strike]
pink lady; but Mrs. Ramsay [strike]who[/strike] was at a remove from pictures,
who
she criticised art almost entirely [strike]from the point of v[/strike]
as she supposed her grandmother's friends would have criticised it, &
the tip
imbuing his
brush [strike]with[/strike] in

pink or grey
now
had imposed a
method, or 
point of view,
could tell [strike]yo[/strike] many a tale of the difficulty these great men
had had in keeping their colours damp.
[strike]First, she told Mr. Tansley, there was the business of grinding the[/strike]
[strike]paints: next they had to be soaked in salad oil.[/strike]
For
among her grandmothers friends, there were many who
mixed their own colours,
[strike]It was a fact that seemed,[/strike] to
first ground them, then soaked them in salad oil; & it was this
attitude which had, was [strike]not[/strike] very critical of this school, &
[strike]Mr.[/strike] Tansley was impressed by the extreme ?derision/?decision with which she
pronounced against Mr. ?Beasley's lighthouse, directly they were out
of hearing.
45
It was often a matter of considerable difficulty. [strike]As[/strike] it had been her
privilege to help sometimes in these studios.] Thus she unveiled slightly the
treasure chamber of her past, which Mr. Tansley felt certain was such a past as
he most coveted full of interesting [strike]people[/strike] [strike]cultivated[/strike] people; with an
& the highest standard
With her sanction
infallible tastes in art & literature.
[strike]With Mrs. Ramsay's sanction,[/strike] he too
dismissed the Paunceforte school of [strike]mod[/strike] painting, [strike]with its[/strike] &

[strike]satirised[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] dismissed with a smile, these pictures of grey
sands & [strike]green wa[/strike] pink ladies which had [strike]none of the qualities[/strike]
obvious defects, since the painters [strike]scamped their work;[/strike] & did not
as Mrs. Ramsay remembered her grandmother's friends doing,
grind their colours for themselves, & keep them moist.
But her

not wish to make a fool of himself, & gush over a woman's
beauty, [strike]moreover[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay was a woman fifty into the
bargain, & had eight children. Still it did come over
how extraordinary it was ?as ?to
him at the moment; & take his breath away. And he noticed how,
as they walked down the street, he carrying her basket, & she
again holding the black parasol erect, people [strike]just[/strike] looked
out as she passed, looked at her as if they were startled & then
looked down, poor men, who were hawking fish, or leaning against
the wall in the sunshine, looked at her, with the same odd
stare; [strike]which[/strike] of which Mrs. Ramsay seemed perfectly unconscious.

she had let him think would be gratified tomorrow. But now - it

long handles would [strike]want[/strike] extraordinary [strike]skl[/strike] skill.
All
these young men parodied her husband, she reflected. If [u]he[/u] said it was

[strike]That loveliness[/strike] So Lily Briscoe & William Bankes
standing there felt in spite of their differences, a common
hilarity, [strike]for a[/strike] [strike]expressed[/strike] excited by the swift cutting
skating movement of a [strike]b[/strike] [strike]b[/strike] sailing boat which,
having sliced a curve in the bay, stopped
shivered, lets its sails fall; & then, [strike]Mr. Bankes,[/strike]
with a natural instinct, [strike]wh[/strike] [strike]which led them to[/strike]
after this swift movement, both of them looked at the
dunes, far away, & instead of merriment felt come over
them some [strike]thing like[/strike] sadness. Yet why? [strike]Was[/strike] It was
[strike]grey green[/strike] partly the grey green colour, & then the
distance; & the everlasting look of distant views
which seem to outlast by a million years the gazer;
to be already communing with a sky which
[strike]look[/strike] beholds an earth entirely at rest. Only,

William Bankes, who had been talking of Ramsay,
thought of him; thought of him, of course, long long ago,
desolate & austere on a mountain road somewhere in
Westmoreland, advancing by himself [strike]into the heart[/strike]
[strike]of th[/strike] that solitude which seemed to be his
?air
natural [strike]to him;[/strike] [strike]only[/strike] which was suddenly interrupted
hung around
with
(& this must actually have happened) by a
hen, advancing [strike][?][/strike] down a path, straddling her wings out in
protection of a whole covey of little chicks, upon
which Ramsay had pointed his stick & said
"Pretty - pretty" - an odd illumination into his heart,
Bankes thought it; & somehow it seemed to him as if
their friendship had ceased at a certain spot on
the mountain road. After that Ramsay had
married. After that, what with one thing or another,
the pulp had gone out of their intimacy. Whose
fault it was, he could not say, only, after a point,
some repetition had taken the place of freshness; &
though
newness
for showing him
tender & simple,
&
with that
love of [strike]humb[/strike] the
humble, the
genuine, wh.
was
95
[strike]they met still,[/strike] It was to repeat, that they met - William Bankes
however maintained in this instantaneous dumb colloquy
that his affection for Ramsay had no way diminished
& there, conserved like a [strike]fossil[/strike] the body of a young man
preserved in peat for a century, fresh with the red on
the lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness & reality,
[strike]kep[/strike] alive again when he looked across the bay at
the sand dunes.
97
[strike]So that[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] He was anxious [strike]to[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike]to convey[/strike] for the sake of this
friendship, & also, perhaps, in order to clear himself in his own
mind from the imputation of having [strike]himself[/strike] dried & shrunk,
for Ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas Bankes was
childless & a widower, - he was anxious that Lily Briscoe
[strike][?][/strike] should not [strike]fall into the error of[/strike] disparage Ramsay; [strike]or,[/strike]
yet
[strike]yet[/strike] should understand how things stood between them.
Begun long ago, their friendship had petered out on a
Westmoreland road, [strike]after which he[/strike] [strike]there had come to pass[/strike]
where the
hen
was
[strike]this curious fact[/strike] - [strike]& then, Ramsay having married,[/strike]
after which Ramsay having married, & their paths lying different
ways, there had been certainly, for no ones fault, [strike]&[/strike]
mainly
some tendency when they met to repeat. [strike]yes.[/strike]
as if it pained him,
   And so turning from the view
Mr. Bankes was [strike]so[/strike]
all alive to little things [strike]in this[/strike] which
would not have struck him,
had not [strike]that[/strike] those sandhills revealed to him the body of his

solitude to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings &
clacking domesticities; which while they had given him
something - William Bankes acknowledged that - [strike]had yet[/strike]

[strike]Silly brainless pretty girls[/strike] - [strike]a bad review[/strike] - to require
encouragement.
   "[strike]Well[/strike] [strike]b[/strike] But, said Lily Briscoe, think of his work."
As always on these occasions, that phantom kitchen table
swam before her, lodged in the fork of a pear tree
(for they had reached the orchard, the strawberry beds, the
vegetable garden.) And with a painful effort of
imagination she conscientiously focused her mind, not upon
the silver bossed bark of the tree, or its fish like leaves, but
upon a mind so differently constituted from her own
that it saw only a kitchen table which was not there.

& why should he not!
Indeed,
It would be delightful if James turned out to be a great artist. And so,
looking up, as [strike]Rhod[/strike] her husband again passed her, she
was relieved to find the ?ruin already veiled; domesticity
crooning
prevailing; custom [strike]casting its[/strike] humming its soothing rhythm; so
that when, drawing up by the window, he bent quizzically &
whimsically down to tickle James' [strike]ca[/strike] bare calf with a

Mrs. Ramsay rebuked her.

   "How [strike]did[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] know? The wind often changed."
she [strike]said[/strike] replied.
   [strike]The extraordinary irrationality of her remark enraged[/strike]
[strike]him.[/strike]
   [strike]When he told her what he happened to know,[/strike]
in his eyes
[strike]she should believe him.[/strike]
He stamped his foot on the

   The toe of his boot scraping on the rough step set her
teeth on edge; & He stamped ?his on the step

And what had she said? Simply that it

   He said he would step over & ask the coast guards if
she liked.
   [strike]And[/strike] There was nobody whom she reverenced as she did

Then
   She would take his word for it, she said. She
would not trouble to cut sandwiches or anything.
There was nobody who so made her feel [strike]so[/strike] safe. [strike]so[/strike].
They came to her, naturally, since she was a woman, all

feel secure &
protected,
this effort of his to arrive at a perfectly clear conception
of the problem which engaged the energies of his splendid [strike]brain[/strike]
intellect.
   The splendid intellect had no sort of difficulty, supposing
thought to be like the keyboard of a piano divided into so

He
reached Q. [strike](And it[/strike] [strike]was then that[/strike] stopping

to be turned from the room - "Mrs. Ramsay & I want to have a little

lay behind it; - as if he ?were [strike]not[/strike] not fit to be there - [strike]as if the[/strike]
[strike]were[/strike]
   And always now, he shrank from her. But
poor old man
what more could she have done? There was [strike]the[/strike] a sunny
room given up to him. Never did she show him the least
sign of not wanting him. [strike]Yet[/strike] She went out of her way, indeed,
to be kind, to be friendly - And after all - after all,
Mrs. Ramsay felt, she had not [strike]to[/strike] generally any difficulty in
?making her friends - Mr. Manning, George Wallace - feel
[strike]at their ease.[/strike] She [strike]had[/strike] [strike]did indeed know in her[/strike]

the

[strike]beauty,[/strike] [strike]that flame which was[/strike]
[strike]the[/strike] the torch of her beauty; & after all, after all -
veil it as she might & even shrink from the
monotony of bearing it imposed on her -
[strike]always to be admired was foolish to her thinking,[/strike]
Still, she had been admired. She had been loved. She
had entered rooms where mourners sat s[strike]olitary.[/strike] Tears,
had flown in her presence. Men, & women too, letting go
[strike]of all that little silly[/strike] the multiplicity of things - [strike]the[/strike]

?distorts - had allowed themselves with her that
[strike]extraordinary[/strike] relief of simplicity. It [strike]now[/strike] injured her
that Mr. Carmichael should shrink. It hurt her.
And yet, not cleanly, rightly. [strike]No.[/strike] [strike]She had[/strike]
That was what she minded - coming as
it did on top of her
discontent with her husband - [strike]she minded[/strike] the
sense she had now, when Mr. Carmichael
shuffled
past with the Spectator beneath his arm, in
his old flapping wide awake, that she was
[?the]
157
suspected, & that all this giving of hers was a form of
vanity. For her own self satisfaction was it, that she wished so
instinctively always to help & give - that they might say
of her, oh Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]there is no on like you.[/strike] Mrs.
Ramsay, Mrs. Ramsay - should call for her, need her, ask her
to

secretly desire all this, & therefore feel, when Mr.
Carmichael shrank away from her, not only the horror
of his [strike]wounds,[/strike] his wincing & flinching, & making off,
away, alone, to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly
[strike]endlessly[/strike], but also, humiliated?

      But the father of eight children has little choice.
With some such phrase as this Mr. Ramsay was apt to sum it all
up, to stop, to sigh, to [strike]fil[/strike] fill his pipe, [strike]to[/strike] seek out his wife, to
[strike]tick[/strike] tease his little boy James, to turn away from the
sight of human ignorance, & the dark dealing of human kind,
which, had he been in a position to contemplate it
fixedly might have absorbed him; & to find consolation in
something [strike]so[/strike] [strike]in itself[/strike] so slight mean, despicable
compared with the august theme of human [strike]ignorance[/strike]
fate
that he was [strike]not[/strike] disposed to slur over his relief, to
dissemble his joy, & [strike]thus[/strike] [strike]to[/strike] thus, disposed to slur it
over & blind himself & deprecate his natural appetite for
Thus
pleasure. Locke, Hume, & Bishop Berkely, & the fact
the figures of
that he had promised in very little over six weeks time -
[strike]in a curious[/strike]
the engagement was fixed for the middle of October - to talk some
nonsense to
[strike]lecture[/strike] the young men of Cardiff upon the English
philosophers, - [strike]al this had[/strike] [strike]these[/strike] this, & the pleasure he
took in it all - the pleasure he took in the compliment, in
the greeting, in the [strike]appla[/strike] phrases he made, in the applause
with which these phrases were greeted, in the
ardour of youth, in the beauty of his wife,
in the
atmosphere of recognition & admiration
which
surrounded him in Cardiff, Swansea,
Exeter, Southampton & Kidderminster when he lectured
upon the English philosophers, all this had to be
[strike]veiled in some[/strike] deprecated, veiled, made little of, - [strike]in[/strike]
 [strike]&[/strike] & if it [strike]had not been[/strike] [strike]because it is not[/strike]
[strike]it was not somehow[/strike] & concealed under the [strike]apparent[/strike]
appearance of dejection. "Talking nonsense to the young

to those [strike]who[/strike] like William Bankes, [strike]or[/strike] Lily Briscoe, who

In Mr.

Carlyle [strike]because of the[/strike] for this very reason. A surly old
shall ?no ?only
grumbler, how [strike]should[/strike] he preach to us was what Mr.
that the young people said nowadays.
Bankes understood them to say.
But Lily Briscoe,
thought that [strike]this being[/strike] human like the rest of us -
being [strike]even[/strike] specially human in a silly babyish way, like Mr.
[strike]Ramsay & Carlyle,[/strike] of wanting praise, & having no self control,
& thinking if one's little finger ached [strike]that the whole[/strike] world
was going to come to an end, this, though not good in itself,
had at any rate one advantage, looked at from an ordinary
[strike]point of view:[/strike] if Mr. Ramsay had been [strike]a [?Cart][/strike] great all through
[strike]consistent,[/strike] perhaps one would not have liked him.
Besides -
that one liked him better for it.
[strike]No he[/strike] Only There was one

one thing when you meant
another
a bit
Being a hypocrite? Mr. Bankes suggested
But who could call Mr. Ramsay a hypocrite? They
could not
looked at him; & no: you
[strike]cannot[/strike] call a man like that a
hypocrite; anything but
a hyprocrite: so shabby, so
distinguished, so
What indeed could they call
him to his face?
Lily Briscoe had to look
down at her brushes, which she was putting away
171
& to concentrate upon the idea of Mr. Ramsay in absence, before she
could put to herself, not to Mr. Bankes, her theory that
he asked too much of his wife (but that was largely her own fault) &
for her own part there was [strike]something[/strike] a side of things - ?typified
she looked at the jacmanna, the wall, the starlings - [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]that was[/strike] something spontaneous, [strike][?][/strike] ?very immediate [?]
which these teachers, of whom of course she was unworthy to
speak, these great men who saw, kitchen tables in pear trees &
lectured, worked & exhibited - of that there could be no doubt in
Mr. Ramsays case, the most perfect [?austerity/?authority] in private life -
there was a side of things which they neglected. Now
take Mr. Ramsay -
      Ah, said Mr. Bankes,
173
[strike]But this had to be to advanced with her eyes turned away. Directly[/strike]
[strike]she looked up &[/strike]

she
involved in
it all again,
Directly she looked up & saw them, became [strike]involved in[/strike]
[u]them[/u] [strike]a part of[/strike] their lives, received a station & had a part
allotted to her, & then of course
[strike]she could no more trace[/strike]
these diagrams [strike]than[/strike] [strike]because[/strike] of Mr. Ramsay & Mrs.
Ramsays [strike]became[/strike] [strike]his[/strike] characters became inundated with
feelings which she could not confine at all in the marks she
had made. Then, [strike]far from be[/strike] [strike]something else[/strike] she was [strike]at[/strike]
could not
retrace,
[strike]once[/strike] aware [strike]how[/strike] of a million million things; which
they both
that man walking, that woman sitting were; [strike]how[/strike] of
they were house & trees & [strike]t[/strike] sky & garden; yes, &
& had her,
in part allotted
to her, &
part of herself too;
[strike]It was odd indeed that[/strike]
[strike]how one felt[/strike] that was the delight of staying with them -
[strike]that they did[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] that every now & then - [strike]when one[/strike]
one was
snapped up
sat down [strike]to dinner, fifteen[/strike] [strike]life[/strike] life broke like a wave on a
rock. [strike]Then, it was not[/strike] & one could not [strike]be sure[/strike]
[strike]whether one was[/strike] [strike]what one was, what any one was[/strike] -

Grasped them up
[strike]took[/strike] one up, [strike]?bent one out,[/strike] & flung one [strike]in[/strike] down,
splash, in one wave.
It was like a wave of the sea
It was
   [strike]In all this,[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]was the prime force[/strike]
that was the prime force in all this; no doubt.

   Now Mrs. Ramsay - Lily Briscoe was
within
175 
[strike]inclined to[/strike] rather [strike]thought she had[/strike] wished [strike]to tell Mr. Bankes[/strike]
rather thought [strike]she[/strike] [strike]h[/strike] had, looking up & looking down,
[strike]arrived[/strike] she had something to say about her; but before she had
said it - [strike]& it was nothing very something[/strike] Mr. Bankes had
[strike]all[/strike] put it out of her head entirely by his rapture. For
such it was, considering his age was turned sixty & he
had both the asperity & the cleanliness of a scientist
spiritually again
wore, [strike]almost[/strike] spiritually, a white coat & smelt of
disinfectants: [strike]For this elderly &[/strike]
For him to gaze at
a rapture
Mrs. Ramsay like that was equivalent,
Lily Briscoe felt, to
the loves of dozens of young men; [strike]but it was dis[/strike] it was
love distilled & filtered; it was love that had never
but
attempted to clutch its object, [strike]but had[/strike] &,
like the love
[strike]of the[/strike] which mathematicians bear their [strike]f[/strike] symbols, &
was meant
to be spread over the
world & made part
of the universal
inheritance
[strike]arti[/strike] writers [strike]bear[/strike] their visions, [strike]it[/strike] it was [strike]intense &[/strike]
both intense & [strike]quite[/strike] impersonal: The world should have
shared it, had it been in his power, [strike]he[/strike] [strike]but it was not[/strike] in
Mr. Bankes power to say why that woman so pleased him.
Why the sight of her, reading fairy stories to her child in
the window, had upon him precisely the same effect as [strike]a[/strike] the
beautiful [strike]solution of[/strike] [strike]piece of work[/strike] [strike]demonstration in[/strike]
solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in
contemplation of it, & felt (as if he had proved something about
that
the digestive system of plants) [strike]how[/strike] the reign of chaos [strike]had[/strike] was
[strike]been[/strike] subdued.
   Such a rapture - for by what word was one to call it? -
made Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to
say. It was nothing of importance; something about
Mrs. Ramsay.
[strike]Yet,[/strike] It paled beside this 'rapture'
(an intense, impersonal, silent stare) of Mr. Bankes', for
which she worshipped him; for she felt that
177
nothing so solaced her [strike]of the[/strike] in the conflict of life, so eased her of the sense
of futility, & miraculously raised all the trivial worry from
her shoulders, as this solemn power. & one no more disturbed it, or
interrupted it then, broke the sunlight lying straight upon
the [strike]matting:[/strike] floor
   That people should love [strike]other people[/strike] their kind, in this way,
was
that Mr. Bankes should feel this for Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]seemed to[/strike] her
so satisfactory, to beautiful, satisfactory,
helpful, [[strike]?][/strike] exalting
[strike]Under the[/strike] She wiped first one brush, then another, [strike]upon[/strike]
with a piece of old rag. [strike]Some[/strike] [strike]As a woman, too[/strike] she
took shelter beneath [strike]the[/strike] a reverence which covered all
herself too
women. [strike]She[/strike] felt praised.
But, when she considered the
[strike]beginning of[/strike] her picture - & she could not help taking a
look at it, after her [strike]afternoon's work,[/strike] walk round the
garden, her picture of the hedge, the wall, & the jachmanna,
[strike]the[/strike] she [strike]could have wept.[/strike] [strike]was discomforted.[/strike] It was so bad.
Mr. Paunceforte would have seen it [strike]all[/strike] half transparent, in
greys & silver, with spots of green & rose. She saw it
[strike]directly[/strike]
[strike]entirely differently;[/strike] [strike]& her picture was already hal[/strike]
heavy & clumsy, - [strike]Still if[/strike] [strike]She saw it[/strike] glaring, staring
in greens & blues. [strike]And[/strike] It would never be hung anywhere;
& it was a waste of time; & Mrs. Tansley
[strike]was always[/strike] said
possibly
Now
She recollected
[strike]saying[/strike] that no woman could paint;
to go on
painting:
[strike]then[/strike] what she had been going to say about Mrs. Ramsay,
when Mr. Bankes [strike]inter[/strike] put it out of her mind, looking as he did;
that
she had been going [strike]to say[/strike] [strike]how[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay always

[strike]seemed to her a[/strike] led the conversation somehow towards [strike]the[/strike]
her funniness. ?That [strike]there was the solemn side, everybody[/strike]
to the funniness of
knew; but did
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]& her being[/strike] as she was
not sheltered by this sort of worship; (for [strike]two women[/strike]
[strike]were[/strike] it was impossible for two women to
for no [strike]two[/strike] women could not [strike]shelter each other[/strike]
worship each other [strike]but as[/strike] could [strike]not[/strike] only seek shelter
it
was
179
under the shade which men like Mr. Bankes extended over them; she
could not look at Mrs. Ramsay quite in that light, though she did
think her [strike]und[/strike] undoubtedly [strike]the most[/strike] much the loveliest of
people; & the best, perhaps; but also [strike]she was odd, she was[/strike]
[strike]so queer,[/strike] she was no more like [strike]th[/strike] what people thought her
[strike]than she was[/strike] than - no comparison came to Lilys mind,
& she wiped [strike]her[/strike] another brush; & began to scrape the
palette of all those mounds of blue & brown which she
knew she would never make do what she wanted,
& yet she would never give up trying to make them do
what she wanted; She was the very opposite of
what[strike]ever[/strike] she
all that - [strike]heroic,[/strike] submissive, devoted, sublime - She was like a
bird for speed; [strike]?or[/strike] like an arrow for decision - She was wilful &
stood
commanding.
She [strike]brooked[/strike] no contradiction. [strike]She[/strike]
(of course, Lily reminded herself, I am [strike]speaking[/strike] thinking of her
relations with women - with a woman who is much
younger than she is) - [strike]she was thinking,[/strike] [strike]for example,[/strike] of
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] open[strike]ing[/strike] all the bedroom windows; of
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay making up matches; of Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
of her determination to [strike]marry[/strike] [strike]one off;[/strike] [strike]of[/strike]
make [strike]one[/strike] [strike]a woman marry a[/strike] men, women marry;
her fixed single & simple belief that no career
She dictated all the doings of the day. Arriving late
at night, with a light tap on the door of one's bedroom,
wrapped in an old fur coat, how [strike]eloque[/strike] vehemently
[strike]dele[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike] how she would [strike]recount the[/strike] run over the tale of
things - sayings, doings, observations & [strike]oddities[/strike] of the day -
adroitly
& [strike]infallibly[/strike] shape them; & how she would insist, or
the
even not think it worth [strike]that[/strike]
trouble, that Lily [strike]would[/strike]
must [strike]of course[/strike] marry; 'must', since in the whole
world, whatever laurels might be tossed her, or
triumphs won by her, there could be no disputing this:
that an unmarried woman [strike]was[/strike] [strike]obviously[/strike] [strike]miserable.[/strike]
had missed the [strike]greatest of[/strike] best of life.

181
But [strike]Lil[/strike] Lily would protest, she could not leave her home;
her father; her [strike]sisters;[/strike] brothers; she would even dare, [strike]to[/strike] as the
white
night drew on, & [strike]between the[/strike] [strike]pale[/strike] light parted the
bedroom curtains, to [strike]proclaim the fact[/strike] [strike]her[/strike] deny for
herself [strike]at least the[/strike] the necessity of marriage; would
her own exemption
on the law
urge that Mrs. Ramsay's law did not apply to her;
& so
the a
have to meet [strike]that[/strike] [strike]serious,[/strike] [strike]intent, almost[/strike] exasperating
stare, [strike]w[/strike] from eyes [strike]which[/strike] [strike]with[/strike] [strike]all their beauty[/strike]
of unparalleled depth; [strike]& the[/strike] to [strike]front the[/strike] confront
Mrs. Ramsays [strike]perfectly[/strike] simple [strike]ex[/strike] conviction, Mrs. Ramsays
[strike]inscrutable[/strike] - [strike]entire[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] unshakable certainty, that she was a
fool.
The, Lily [strike]remembered,[/strike] it was [strike]hop[/strike] impossible; then she
lap one must
remembered, one had to lay one's head on her knee; & laugh -
[strike]until[/strike]
laugh - laugh - & Mrs. Ramsay said [?]
the thought of her
to laugh & laugh at Mrs. Ramsay, presiding so [strike]sternly so[/strike]
beautifully so unquestioningly [strike]over[/strike] yet somehow so
women
mistakenly over the destinies of [strike]others[/strike]. But into what
with simple
misunderstanding
sanctuary had one penetrated? Lily Briscoe had
[strike]made herself[/strike] looked up at last; & there was Mrs. Ramsay
unwitting entirely what caused her laughter, still presiding
[strike]serene;[/strike] [strike]but[/strike] [strike]on[/strike] but now with every trace [strike]of the[/strike] [strike]tyrant, of the[/strike]
wilfulness abolished; & in its place the calm of tropic

something soft as the

Was it [strike]tiredness[/strike]? Was it knowledge? Was [strike]there[/strike] it [strike]again[/strike]
?again
the deceptiveness of beauty, or did she lock up in her
own person that final knowledge [strike]of[/strike] which certainly Lily
Briscoe believed that [strike]some[/strike] people must have; for
it was not possible that all [strike]people[/strike] of [strike]us[/strike] should be as
or the word
did not
exist;
[strike]little[/strike] helter skelter as she was, [strike]living from hand to mouth,[/strike]

what they knew
could they [strike]communicate[/strike]?
Sitting on the floor, with her
arms round Mrs. [strike]B[/strike] Ramsay's knees,
[strike]she[/strike] close as she could
get, she imagined how in the chambers of the

the
[strike]of that[/strike]

touching her,
(& she
hugged

tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which, if one penetrated
to those chambers one could spell out; but they would never

[strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike]
[strike]less[/strike] like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same?
[strike]Did nearness of the body achieve[/strike] Could the body
achieve it - [strike]mingling its[/strike] essences, fearlessly & wholly? or

Mr. Bankes was looking at her picture. [strike]She had exposed[/strike]
[strike]to the[/strike]
world something [strike]which[/strike] that another person should see what she
[strike]had stated there, & pronounce[/strike] had concocted [strike]& stated;[/strike] what [strike]was[/strike]

the residue of
something mysterious

& sudden exaltation at being able to discuss the matter

he had spent his honeymoon. Lily felt that there was nothing that
he would not give up in the cause of truth. It interested him, &
he would [strike]stand[/strike] give his best mind to the question [strike]of[/strike] which
[strike]vexed[/strike] her of [strike]this[/strike] the relations between one part of her picture
&
absorbed
[strike]to[/strike] another part of her picture. So that she put herself again
into position; again considered the thing as a whole.
Was the triangular purple perhaps too heavy,
so that the
[strike]light sky[/strike] sky became too light? [strike]How should one[/strike] &
[strike]link up[/strike] [strike]bridge the[/strike] [strike]connect the[/strike] two chief blocks of matter
[strike]so that[/strike] must somehow be joined together -
Ah well, she broke off returning again, apologetically to the
extreme modesty of [strike]?spinster art.[/strike] [strike]a painting[/strike] uneducated
womanhood; & took it off the easel
   [But her picture has been looked at; her picture
it had been placed
had been cut from her;
& had taken its place on the other
the obsequious
dejected
?deplorable
side [strike]of that deep &[/strike] of that horrid little ditch, [strike]where[/strike] which
[strike]that[/strike] men like Charles Tansley cut so indefatigably

But here was somebody who made it seem possible to paint a
picture; &, returning to the normal relationship
again; not

[strike]not [/strike]his extraordinary magnaminity,

[strike]how odd it was, sometimes[/strike] [strike]to[/strike] be which lightened the whole
of her horizon [strike]w[/strike] - for here was a man, & one of the most
brilliant too (she had heard Mr. Ramsay
[strike]desc[/strike] call him
who [strike]did not[/strike]
the most brilliant botanist in Europe)
would let one talk to him.
That was the sort of thing
that did happen, if one stayed with the Ramsays -
one lived for 30 year
believing this to be true; suddenly here
was
Mr. Bankes
- & one cd. talk about painting. [strike]Now with[/strike]

   For Cam grazed the easel by an inch; she would not stop for
Mr. Bankes & Lily Briscoe; though Mr. Bankes would have liked her to 
stop: she would not stop for her father whom also she grazed
by an inch; nor for her mother, who called Cam! as she
dashed past, [strike]For[/strike] She [strike]was off[/strike] [strike]For she wanted[/strike] -
or
She was off - [strike]She was[/strike] like a bird, a [strike]pu[/strike] bullet, an arrow,

at what she was directed, who could say? [strike]A vision, a[/strike]

thinking of something
different
   The little girls mind was completely [strike]vacant,[/strike] as Mrs.
Ramsay saw; & the message which Cam was to take to
Andrew &
kitchen.
Mildred in the [?guestroom/?question] - Have Miss Doyle & Mr. Rayley come back? -
had to be repeated twice, to be dropped into [strike]that[/strike] those [strike]extraord[/strike]
those [strike]extraordinary depths, at once so[/strike] that well, where if the
waters were clear they
simple
were
words
also so extraordinarily distorting
about
that, even as the [strike]words[/strike]
descended, one saw them twisting: [strike]from side to[/strike]
to the cook
[strike]side[/strike]
What message [strike]Cam[/strike]
would Cam deliver,
Mrs. Ramsay wondered?
And indeed it was only by [strike]a[/strike]
the use of a parrot like instinct
to make heaven
knew
& lying in the
what
[?pattern]
strangest order
upon the floor
which reproduced her mothers
words accurately [strike]without any[/strike]
deprived of all meaning
in a [strike]kind[/strike] an absent minded singsong
that Cam asked,
[strike]looking at[/strike] staring at Mrs. McLeod,
who [strike]was on a visit, & had[/strike]
had come to ask for blankets, &
wore bugles,
Have Andrew, Miss Doyle & Mr. Rayley
come back?
& not considering [strike]th[/strike]
So that [strike]when[/strike] the answer to Mrs. Ramsays
[strike]question[/strike] was that a very old woman was in the kitchen who
wore bugles.
& [strike]not[/strike] not

reply - No -
they have not

Mrs. McLeod had come to get her blankets, Mrs. Ramsay divined, - [strike]She[/strike] for her
who
[strike]whose[/strike] mother was dying of cancer - but as for the message
about Andrew & the others, [strike]that[/strike] [strike]that could[/strike] the answer to that
[strike]could only be[/strike] was only to be reached by waiting patiently for
Cam to repeat, like a sleep walker, "No they haven't, & I've
told Ellen to clear away tea."
   Minta Doyle Paul Rayley had not come back. And
?Then/?You
[strike]what did that mean?[/strike]
It could only mean, Mrs. Ramsay thought,
that something had happened - that she had made up her
mind, that there was an end of all those hesitations which,
go on
indefinitely
while they did her honour, could not be[strike] prolonged[/strike] [strike]without[/strike]

[strike]Either[/strike] she must accept [strike]him[/strike], or she must refuse

right, of course
for nothing needed
more care,

And this going off after luncheon for a walk,
even though Andrew was with them, - what could it mean?
& she was very very
fond of Minta,
[strike]One did not[/strike] Except that [strike]after[/strike] she had decided, rightly,
Mrs. Ramsay thought, to accept Paul Rayley who was
obviously entirely devoted to her, a good fellow, [strike]&[/strike] one
yng fellows
of the nicest [strike]young men[/strike] she knew - which was not saying
of course that he was brilliant, for that he was not, but
it would be a [strike]very[/strike] happy marriage, Mrs. Ramsay thought, &
[strike]they would have very lovely babies,[/strike] & he would do well enough,
but that did not matter for he had prospects, &
[strike]& there would be lovely children, & in short Minta would be[/strike]
She She [strike]tried to seen[/strike] saw them going off after lunch,
[strike]down the path to the gate, &[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]tried to see Minta, with[/strike][strike][/strike]
she had no
doubt
[strike]the expression on Minta's[/strike]
[strike]face, & to the thought of which[/strike]

looking at the sky, wondering about wet or
fine, which she knew was only
to push them off
to cover their being shy; &
so she had said that there wasn't a

But [strike]then[/strike] perfect imbeciles are, she thought, [strike]need[/strike] necessary
sometimes - & it did not matter a fig -
[strike]However[/strike] - [strike]Those[/strike]

   Here James [strike]pointed[/strike] drew her attention to the
had just time
story of the Woodman's daughter, which they could possibly

finish before bed[strike]time[/strike] if Cam would only decide whether she
sit still
wanted to play in the garden, or to to hear about the little
girl who [strike]wanted to[/strike] had tea with the bears in the
[strike]middle of the[/strike] forest.
   And so they had gone off, Mrs. Ramsay remembered,
as she found her place, down the drive, & she rather thought
Nancy [strike]had[/strike] join[strike]ed[/strike] them, so there would be four of them, &
who knows whether, in the [strike]cir[/strike] circumstances, anything would

the [strike]moment[/strike] how difficult it is to stop talk, once it
begins, she knew; & here, at the ends of the earth as they
were, she was responsible to Minta's parents, if
Minta could be said to have parents, which Mrs.
Ramsay doubted: you could scarcely call [strike]that starched[/strike]
a man with a chin like that!
But had Nancy gone?

distracting the attention of [strike]that[/strike] Charles Tansley, Minta Doyle had
implored her to come, not in words; Minta was dumb; but
in speechless language which roused in Nancy's heart a
elation
an extraordinary [strike]ecstasy[/strike]. [strike]For[/strike] [strike]having no character[/strike] [strike]to speak of,[/strike]

Once a woman had accused her of
robbing her of her daughter's affection
& indeed she resented it, &
[strike]owed a grudge[/strike] possibly

at the head of the stairs. Between them they had produced, among
other children this perfectly incongruous creature, with this
passion for the open air & a hole, it seemed to Mrs. Ramsay,
perpetually
[strike]always[/strike] in the heel of her stocking.
Seeing her there in that

as
portentous atmosphere where,
[strike]it[/strike] [strike]seemed[/strike] to
Mrs. Ramsay, a maid

of that bird, Mrs. Ramsay had asked her to lunch, to dinner, to tea, to
stay with them finally - which had resulted in some friction with her mother,

only to be appeased by more calling, more conversation more gravel;
&
[strike]with[/strike] Mrs. Doyle for some reason suspected, her. Indeed, Mrs.

Ramsay divined that here was another [strike]occasion[/strike] occasion [strike]of[/strike]

She was accused of dominating, & [strike]of[/strike] interfering, [strike]of[/strike]
making people do her will rather than their own - a perfectly
genuinely believed;
baseless accusation;
Mrs. Ramsay thought, & yet if she had had
time & wealth, she would have liked to [strike]give[/strike] [strike]give expression to a[/strike]

to get a [strike]really good[/strike]

often milk was delivered at her
in a state which was possibly dangerous
to health, illegal; to

were older, she would have time [strike]for[/strike] perhaps for doing more -
ah, but she never wanted them to grow a day older!
They were adorable, just as they were; & it made her
miserable to see them growing
into long legged monsters -
Cam & James
they
had been
when

[strike]like[/strike] [strike]mere[/strike] bundles of delight - & she had been able to

but [strike]they were[/strike] it was Cam's fault mostly, because she was older, & a

Still, without being in vain, she hoped

was beautiful; Andrew - her husband thought he had an

the moment they cared for nothing but cricket & football, but
a perfect angel
of goodness to
the others - &
the only one who was
really beautiful
he was one of those
boys who care for

A child's power of happiness was something indescribable.
Cam could still be happy for days with a tenpenny tea set.
It seemed to Mrs. [strike]Ramsay that[/strike] T[strike]t[/strike]hey began early in the morning.
[strike]A ?ch sound of[/strike] Shouting & stamping began over her head in
the nursery about seven o'clock. Then they came [strike]burs[/strike]
bursting along the passages, & then the door sprang open &
in they came, James royally seated in Susie's arms;
Cam, plucking at her apron, [strike]both so sure[/strike] [strike]as if it[/strike]
staring,
both [strike]g[/strike] wide awake,
as if this coming into the dining room
after breakfast were
a positive event to them - & so on,
all day long; till she went up to say good night, & found
them netted into their cots, like birds among cherries &
strawberries, [strike]still crowing & shouting with[/strike] flushed &
mischievous, & still so [strike]happy that, as she[/strike] entirely &

He [strike]was[/strike] [strike]could not[/strike] did not like her to take what he called

& perhaps
anyhow, making
phrases was a
great alleviation,

& she wished she
had the power, but
more robust perhaps,
not that she did despair, even of some
sort of final arrangement
by which the tragedies & sorrows
should be made [strike]up,[/strike] good:
it was only that if one did not
accept the usual beliefs
& if one had lived, as she had, fifty

[strike]on the whole,[/strike] something of the suffering that
went on - for instance among the poor, & [strike]in one[/strike] [strike]had[/strike]

made neither into
worn
a beautiful beauty nor into habit: but had [strike]kept[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] sharp &
uncompromising, at [strike]the[/strike] her heart, like a hair shirt)
   Then, how could one be thoughtlessly,
about wh people
debated - had it
any real existence
or not? -
it happened
to be in [?truth]
205
completely, rapturously happy, like those heavenly children, who
have her way
must
[strike]would[/strike] grow up & lose it all?
If she could
arrange it, James &
Cam should always remain like this - sitting beside her, listening to
the story of the woodman's daughter. [strike]Indeed, she[/strike] She would like [u]always[/u]
to have a baby: though indeed she had no right to have had
how much
it meant
eight, considering that [strike]it meant a good deal of[/strike] anxiety - [strike]how to g[/strike]
giving all the boys a proper education - & there was the
greenhouse roof that wanted mending; & it meant that he
had to make some money [strike]every year to supplement their income;[/strike]
though she was resolved that he should never [strike]desert his[/strike]
[strike]have[/strike] to give up his own [strike][?][/strike] [strike]special[/strike] work, his philosophy - [strike]that[/strike]
however hard
they were pressed
pursuit of the letter Z [strike]which still escaped him[/strike] - [strike]As for[/strike]
[strike]herself, she[/strike] For that was the most important of all things
& she could manage somehow.
   Anyhow, Minta Doyle would miss the best thing in the
whole world if she had no children. Of that Mrs. Ramsay
was
?one
positive. Argument was [strike]so[/strike] silly - how could [strike]you[/strike] argue?
[strike]Sometimes she[/strike] Anyone wilfully missing or putting aside for
[strike]any reason[/strike] that side of life was so [strike]pitia[/strike] profoundly to be pitied
that Mrs. Ramsay for one almost thought that the State
the chance
of motherhood
should make some arrangement by which every woman had
[strike]at least[/strike] the opportunity - [strike]Only[/strike] But [strike]sh[/strike] there remained
of course something else - [strike]that[/strike] relationship of man & woman
[strike]which[/strike] husband & wife. Minta was perfectly right to think it over.
Nothing would induce Mrs. Ramsay to hurry her: she must
remind herself, she must curb herself, she must, whatever
of the
happened, check that masterfulness which, she admitted
was in her, [strike]here;[/strike] [strike]she must[/strike] [strike]for once she[/strike] had made a
match, & she had regretted it. It was one of the things she blamed
herself for

[strike]So[/strike] the little girl was carried up to bed, & fell fast asleep [strike]until she[/strike]
& dreamed of [strike]the forest.[/strike] all night of the bears in the forest.
And thats the end, she said, shutting the book. [strike]&[/strike]
[u]X[/u]
   The children were not
anxious -
She must [strike]face[/strike] get up & find out [strike]about[/strike]
[strike]whether[/strike]
Even as she [strike]could hardly[/strike] sit still
possessed by that sudden fear,
that picture of disaster, of somebody
falling, & [strike]ask[/strike] find out; but
they were not anxious [strike]in the least,[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike] they were quite absorbed, still, by the story; both of them sitting
perfectly still & [strike]looking[/strike] then she saw what was it? - something
extraordinarily beautiful; a sort of wonder in their faces; an
a look of awe, of rapture, as if both of them [strike]had[/strike] they had
[strike]been[/strike] there had mingled with the dying strains of the fairy story
some new astonishing pleasure. It was the lighthouse.
Yes, they
the lighthouse had been lit, & they could see it rather pale at first, in the
slow
making its three strokes across the bay: the
[strike]long[/strike] one first; then the
two quick ones. But James would begin to [strike]think about his[/strike]
disappointment; they were not going there, his father said;
Happily here was Mildred, come to take them to bed: before he
remembered.
Off they trotted, for nobody would carry
James any [strike]more.[/strike] &
Theres the lighthouse she said, [strike]loo[/strike]
Yes, it was beginning; rather pale still in the halflight; like [strike]a[/strike]
indeed it looked almost like very [strike]pale[/strike] sun [strike]beams, & it only[/strike] still,
just touching the waves.
   Where is he? thought Mrs. Ramsay - she looked for
her husband.
211
[u]Feb. 22nd[/u]
[u]X[/u]
   The children were not anxious. They were absorbed still by the story.
One could almost see them both pondering those last words about
the little girl dreaming of the bears; & then, as that [strike]story[/strike] faded,
[strike]suddenly[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay saw [strike]them, both[/strike] come into their eyes
it was
some new wonder - Oh the lighthouse! [strike]Yes, they had[/strike]
something pale,
ecstatic
lit [strike]the lighthouse. That[/strike] Turning she looked across the [strike]B[/strike] bay,
& there, sure enough, was that pale light, which, at the moment,
almost
light
one might mistake for sunshine;
but it came & went, over

[strike]the sea: first[/strike] only it came & went, [strike]a first[/strike] two quick
strokes & then one long steady stroke, silvering the waves faintly,
for it was still light.
begin to ask whether they were
   James would think about going to the lighthouse: [strike]his[/strike]
& they were not going to the Lighthouse: his father said it was impossible
out [strike]of the question:[/strike]
But happily, here was Mildred
[strike]he[/strike] he wd. think
[?gloomily]
to ?take in
off
them to bed; [strike]but Cam[/strike] & then, she
trusted he would forget
all
about going to the Lighthouse.
But she doubted it.
Children never forgot anything.
   No, [strike]they forget nothing,[/strike] she thought, putting together some
pictures
he had cut out
of the bits of paper that were strewn

[strike]about the floor,[/strike] - the
refrigerator, the
gentleman in the yellow shirt front, the
mowing machine, -
& taking her knitting.
They forgot nothing.
But
She sighed.
It was a great relief when they did go to bed.
For now she [strike]was[/strike]
need not think about anybody for a
moment
She could be herself, by herself; & that was what now she
had [strike]come[/strike] often felt the need of - to
to think. [strike]What then was it?[/strike] To be alone.
And as it
happened that she was more often left alone in the evening,
be
[strike]the[/strike] it was familiar to her to watching that lighthouse, as she
was [strike]sewing[/strike] knitt[strike]ing[/strike]ed; [strike]& it was[/strike] the two quick strokes & then

& ?it
still
the long stroke. The [strike]And[/strike] Of the three strokes it was the [strike]third[/strike]
really felt in sympathy with. The third stroke was
[?], looking
up from
her knitting
at
think, well, not even
213
that [strike]with[/strike] which [strike]seemed[/strike] to her the real one; if it could be said
that one thing was more [strike][?][/strike] real than another thing It was
like that - [strike]quite ruthless, quite direct[/strike] - [strike]And[/strike] For she had a
sense of [strike]their[/strike] there [strike]being[/strike] something in one, in her at least,
the one she was so
tired of
more real, most real, herself[strike];[/strike] ? [strike]or[/strike] no no: not the self that went about
[strike]but[/strike] not ever
doing things; & not the self here, now, in this room; [strike]yes,[/strike] &
when there was no one to be nice to; no children; no husband; for that ?did ?not,
Or was it life?
but
Then [strike]was[/strike] one was rather awful, she thought,
that ruthless direct stroke, that third stroke, [strike]which[/strike] was [strike]what[/strike]
the real one, & [strike]as[/strike] one [strike]did not[/strike] could not escape. Children never
forget. What we have done, we have done. but the shelf which was
at the beck & call - could one deny it? - of - She [strike]did not know[/strike]
never had a word for it, she was singularly dumb; she thought of it
third stroke
as that - there - the long [strike]direct[/strike] [strike]ruthless stroke[/strike]
Children never
enough
She woke up in the
night & saw it stroking
[strike]crossing[/strike] the floor
forget; [strike]she knew that perfectly well; & the lighthouse had[/strike]
[strike]nothing to teach her about that: No.[/strike]
for example: she was
all
growing old; for example: [strike]&[/strike] they would die, & it would be over.
Well?
And [strike]who was going to deny[/strike] that?
She looked over [strike]the[/strike] her
knitting, [strike]when she said to her husband, how at the back of her[/strike]
[strike]mind she did not despair, there was that, just that.[/strike]
[strike]Merely, she supposed, every rational person in the course of[/strike]
[strike]life achieves what is after all only common sense:[/strike] they said
(her mother said) We are in the hands of the Lord; Sshe never
had
[strike]had[/strike] the least inclination to say that. We are in the hands
of the Lord - How could any Lord create a world of such [strike]suffering[/strike]
pain
such horrible injustice? But the Lighthouse was
quite
a [strike]little[/strike] different. It was
[strike]perfectly[/strike] ruthless; [strike]but it was[/strike]
doubt
nobody had any [strike]illusions[/strike] about that, [strike]but[/strike] it came; it went;
&, flowing
& [strike]somehow,[/strike] [strike]as one grew[/strike]
[strike]older one learnt felt that very[/strike] thing [strike]in ones[/strike]
[strike]bones.[/strike] itself was in one bones. It had her own expression.

She was like it.
Her eyes she felt were full of it:
[strike]that[/strike] It drew her to it.
For [strike]when she was quite alone,[/strike] it [strike]was[/strike] odd, being alone,
how surprisingly strong [strike]the[/strike] one finds [strike]some[/strike] those [?thing]
then
almost forgotten & perfectly foolish feelings - ?&
is
215
community with things which have no bearing upon one's life at all.
Flowers, yes; & some lonely places, where [strike]she, who was hardly ever[/strike]
alone
?one
alone, went down to ?drink, [strike]laying aside her clothes at the rivers' edge,[/strike]
[?ones]
?there
ones
putting off [strike]the[/strike] [strike]greenhouse[/strike] clothes, laying aside clothes
That was what she would consider, when they were all grown up; & she
?how it
had time. [strike]Then[/strike] S[strike]s[/strike]he would get it straight.
She would find out what it
how there is
other relationship; not

between herself
how there is one
relation: James & her
husband: another,
herself &
the other relationship, of mind [strike]&[/strike] what did one call it?
She
[strike]held[/strike] stopped knitting.
She [strike][?][/strike] gazed again, with some irony in her
interrogation, at that [strike]lovely[/strike] cryptic light:
that silent light; [strike]that[/strike]
which was silvering the waves a little more brightly, as
daylight faded.
She had for it some irrational tenderness;
it gave her, as it gave her
children, some queer ecstasy; [strike]some ?&[/strike] the
sight of [strike]that[/strike]
those lights, the two quick lights & then
the long light, which
say what you like (& as for her husband, he would say, quite tenderly,
gave her
that it was nonsense)
such happiness as almost transcended
worry & loss: how they had not come back: & might be killed.
For [strike]if[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] there was no treachery too base for the world [strike]not[/strike] to
commit: of that she was well aware. All she replied to
the worlds treachery was, (& she [strike]grasped her stock[/strike] knitted
with her firm composure, & a little pressure of the lips)
But she made no reply.

She watched the lighthouse for a
minute or two. [strike]There was no reply.[/strike]
For in asking this or that of

in

life,

praying questioning, mo one

must have at one's command

[strike]made[/strike]
[strike]language, which she[/strike]
[strike]had not; one must be[/strike]
[strike]made differently; for[/strike]
[strike]in her[/strike]
[strike]for she never saw things, or formulated things; but[/strike]
[strike]only opposed to fate, what she[/strike]
[strike]?was, that she did not[/strike]
[strike]by any means give way; & was able to understand without moving[/strike]
[strike]from her chair[/strike]
[strike]altogether[/strike]
was [strike]to[/strike] this twofold nature; [strike]of the[/strike][strike][/strike]
217
of the three strokes.
The third stroke was her stroke; but what did she mean by that?
She was singularly dumb. She found herself sitting & looking,
sitting & looking, until she almost became the thing she looked at.
And she
said to herself;
I am
it will all have to end.
Children never forget, [strike]she[/strike] was growing old;
[strike]we are[/strike] in the hands of 
no she never said that
the Lord. - But
[strike]though she used those words,[/strike] [strike]she[/strike] did not mean
And the light [strike]went[/strike]
came [strike]&w[/strike] & went;
it was ruthless; it
had no pity; & it
[strike]part[/strike] had become
part of her thoughts
but the futility
of the words
seemed to
& it was not that.
for a tree, for a
stream,
for anything;
as for
oneself;
a lake
She [strike]gazed[/strike]
why one fel
anything
like
that
Mysterious
word
Mystery of oneself, ones
The bride & the lover -
the relation
between
oneself & it - &
being it
?with [?] times so
[strike]or[/strike]
them at all; [strike]but[/strike] No.
[strike]She was much felt much more[/strike]
[strike]in sympathy with the long third stroke, which she saw[/strike]
[strike]bent, half on the bed, half on the floor, when she woke up[/strike]
[strike]at night.[/strike]
[strike]She looked up over her knitting.[/strike]
[strike]How[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]could any Lord have made a world like this? And[/strike][strike][/strike]
And
[strike][strike]Precisely.[/strike][/strike]
She looked up over her knitting, meeting the third
stroke which [strike]somehow[/strike] seemed
to her like her own eyes meeting her
own eyes; & [strike]yet of course[/strike] [strike]for[/strike]
It was odd how when one was alone
that they expressed things
in one, became part of one,
[strike]some[/strike] one felt these leanings towards
things which had no
bearing on ones own life; [strike]so that one[/strike]
[strike]attributed[/strike]
how one felt [strike]that[/strike] irrational tenderness; how one felt ([strike]that[/strike]
just sitting here alone knitting) as if inside, far down,
there rose up like a wraith, like a mist curling off
rising
water, some ghost, [strike]some[/strike] bride,
to meet the lover.
She was
[strike]Indeed what happened was simply[/strike]
[strike]When[/strike] [strike]She[/strike] She would try
to get it all straight one of these
days, when they were
all grown up; - For [strike]certainly[/strike] [strike]there was a[/strike]
when
&
like this
the children went to bed,
she sat knitting, alone; [strike]then[/strike] &
[strike]then[/strike] she [strike]liked[/strike] to be
[strike]sure that there was something there:[/strike]
[strike]what[/strike] found [strike]this[/strike]
[strike]thing in her; she found herself & as she[/strike]

[strike]was sitting here, she connected naturally with the[/strike]
[strike]lighthouse;[/strike] &
[strike]Often[/strike]
things in her: & looking at the lighthouse,
[strike]she connected it[/strike]
she had that queer association; no doubt
some people
had it,
but
with the light, which [strike]was so[/strike]
as it [strike]came & went, seemed to have her[/strike]
just seemed to her -
what could she [strike]call[/strike] it? -
B
[strike]For[/strike]
how could any Lord
have made this world? How indeed?
with its vice, its
torture. [strike]No;[/strike]
They had not come back. They might be
killed.
There was no treachery too base for
the world to commit.
Of that she
219
[strike]was aware[/strike]. No baseness too despicable even in men & women.
No
that lasted
[strike]And ?their[/strike] happiness [strike]was not lasting.[/strike] [strike]And they[/strike]
She [strike]turned her[/strike] She knitted with firm composure, slightly [strike]p[/strike]
pursing her lips, so that when Mr. Ramsay passed her, [strike]?he[/strike]
though he was thinking [strike]of Hume &[/strike] how Hume having grown
fat
?as
enormously stout, stuck in a bog, he could not help [strike]but[/strike]
making a note of that severity, which was part of her beauty, -
stroke
[strike]There was her light again, the third stroke.[/strike][strike][/strike]
It was [strike]the[/strike] long
[strike]third stroke, direct & im -[/strike]
[strike]And she thought with a[/strike]
the soul of it, the
flame.
Yet it
distressed him.
[strike]sort of carelessness which in the she could was entirely[/strike]
she thought
Nothing she minded for herself,
[strike]No happiness[/strike] And they must die.
For herself she
quite reckless.
[strike]That indeed was[/strike] one [strike]of[/strike] thing that struck her -
how reckless
she cd. ?have
?been
probably if it were not for the children, she was
reckless: [strike]rather[/strike] unscrupulous, as in this matter of arranging
marriages; [strike]& rather[/strike] intolerant of restriction [strike]If she had been rich[/strike]
If she had had more money - if she had been for example, Lady So & So -
She stopped knitting. She gazed with some irony in her
interrogation, some veiling of her eye, at that [strike]cry[/strike] steady
light, that remorseless light, [strike]which was however was so[/strike]
[strike]searching, so pure[/strike] [strike]& its[/strike] which ?was so much her; [strike]And yet[/strike]
& so little her at the same [strike]time;[/strike] had her at its beck & call,
perhaps; but for all that
she
[strike]was extremely conscious[/strike] - she
[strike]I dont[/strike] she did
not find
it easy to give in -
watching it
thought watching it silvering the waves a little more
brightly as daylight faded - she [strike]never[/strike] could [strike]not[/strike]
[strike]a[/strike] abdicate [strike]her own power, as some people could, she[/strike]
[strike]she never did submit:[/strike] [strike]her own[/strike] she [strike]was not[/strike] did not find it
easy to give way - & [strike]her[/strike] it came & rolling [strike]pur[/strike]
waves of pure lemon, [strike]lovely & ethereal,[/strike] upon the beach.
[strike]For[/strike]
[strike]And yet[/strike]
For
they
it distressed [strike]him,[/strike] Mr. Ramsay, passing again -
[strike]not her[/strike] [strike]she[/strike] not that her temperament [strike]was[/strike]
[strike]should[/strike]
had part in
that severity
it
in
[strike]among oth[/strike] [strike]with all its simple[/strike] he [strike]found[/strike]
[strike]tinged with[/strike] melancholy
But he felt that he would not like to interrupt her: there
are moments of [strike]great[/strike] estrangement:
the [strike]fits of[/strike] irritability
she did not
scorn
envy

221
beauty in her
mind but
& all its beauty
[strike]was[/strike] burnt in her, as in her childrens
eyes; such ecstasy
[strike]there was for her &[/strike]
[strike]such irrational joy.[/strike] of joy,
or from wonder
at beauty
[strike]between them. She passed sometimes out of his reach. He could not[/strike]
w
[strike]like to interrupt her For him, there was something awful, suddenly, in[/strike]
Nor could [strike]he reach[/strike] her, nor save her, nor protect her even from the
negation of his own miserable importunities: his demands; his
irritability.
Hume stuck in a bog & an old woman [strike]only[/strike]
rescued him on condition he said the Lords Prayer.
He snorted out his sudden laugh as he passed her He was not sure
how far that story would
go down at Cardiff.
He would ask [strike]his wife[/strike] her.
But he would
[strike]take her hand[/strike] & put it to his
lips,
with his
extraordinary charm,
his
extreme sympathy,
[strike]asking her, to[/strike]
[strike]forgive him, saying to her[/strike]
his directness which
disarmed her always,
& [strike]that[/strike] what could he

whether she thought that
Mrs. Bowley [strike]was[/strike] would be shocked
(For they were staying with the Bowleys at Cardiff)
   "Hume grew to be very fat, &
It awed
him; it
saddened him;

It distressed him; it saddened him, Mr. Ramsay thought, passing a second
the spasms of
time. He could not save her; he could not protect her not even
from his own miserable irritability. [strike]He had been[/strike]
[strike]annoyed[/strike] foolishly irritated
about
the Lighthouse

intolerable

thoughts. He had [strike]this[/strike] [strike]these[/strike]
his
lectures to write. "And Hume,
grown very fat stuck in a bog & an old woman rescued him
on condition he said the Lord's Prayer" -
He drew up
& snorting a queer snort of laughter, beside the window, wanting
[strike]He wanted[/strike] to ask [strike]her[/strike] his wife if he could tell that story at
Cardiff.
[strike]But[/strike] But as even Lily Briscoe allowed, in
[strike]her w[/strike] those moment of violent irritation with Mr. Ramsay
which, occurring at breakfast for example, when he
behaved with more than usual blindness to the feelings of
others, when he was more than usually bleak, cutting &
disagreeable - so that her egg spoon trembled in her hand, &
she flushed with anger - [strike]if she, &[/strike] even she, at that
moment had to admit ([strike]if [/strike]directly she looked up) that
[strike]he was[/strike] there was a scrupulosity about him: he never
[strike]devoured [?downed] you;[/strike] over came your privacy: but on the contrary, had some sort of
[strike]even in[/strike] perfect manners; not politeness; but [strike]integrity[/strike]
[strike]breeding[/strike] (only it was difficult to find words for what she
meant, save that she could have gone to him [strike]for[/strike] in a
crisis - say, if she wished to become a Roman Catholic [strike])[/strike]
so now,
& he would have respected her personality -) [strike]but,[/strike] [strike]though[/strike]
though he wished to speak to [strike]her,[/strike] his wife he did not
like to interrupt her.
He could not protect her, alas. And
it was Mrs. Ramsay
who looked at him; Mrs. Ramsay whose
lips parted; as she
resumed her knitting & Mrs.
Ramsay who returned[strike], &[/strike]
to him, & resumed intercourse with him

of her own free will, oh yes; for he was wanting her to come out into the
garden with him, wanting her, but would not [strike]for an instant[/strike] break in

   To save going upstairs she pulled the green shawl off the
easel, &, wrapping it round her, took his arm for a stroll.

year - & whether t[strike]o employ that[/strike] go on employing Kennedy, the

at Cardiff, whether they would be shocked if her [strike]?rem[/strike] stayed at an
Inn; [strike]for[/strike] [strike]when he[/strike] [strike]& not with them,[/strike]

boredom of their [strike]evening[/strike] [strike]parties[/strike]
domestic evenings; [strike]&[/strike]

air gun.
[strike]It was a horrible instinct,[/strike] [strike]but[/strike]

Poor Carmichael
seemed tolerably cheerful, though it might be better not to

Mrs. Ramsay, would have been her refuge had she married

[strike]She had him a[/strike]

The atheist -
the little atheist -
He was not a polished specimen,

She supposed it was all right.

She [strike]had heard[/strike]
a good deal
said
about that, Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]said.[/strike] rather significantly;
But
then, said Mr. Ramsay, it was all he had to count on.
said Mrs. Ramsay
stopping to consider
her dahlias.
At any rate, Prue would not marry him If she did, he
would disinherit her tomorrow, said Mr. Ramsay, but added
that there was no harm in the
youth: he was not
&
about
prepossessing.
[strike]But[/strike] as
he was
the only young man who [strike]was[/strike]

read his - Mr. Ramsays -
books.
But it was a question of Kennedy,
the gardener - She
could never be sure that he planted the bulbs she sent

him.
Resolved no to [strike]worry[/strike] her with his own affairs again,
[strike]Mr. R[/strike] & priding himself for his forbearance, Mr. Ramsay
observed that the hot pokers seemed creditable.
But
then Mrs. Ramsay had planted the hot pokers with her
own hands.
If she stood over him with a spade all
day long he occasionally did do something.
She was
teaching her daughters to exaggerate, [strike]he said.[/strike] Mr Ramsay said.
Mrs. Ramsay [strike]owned that she had[/strike] said that [strike]it[/strike]
her great Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was.
But nobody ever held up Aunt Camilla as a model of
her
virtue, said Mr. Ramsay. [strike]Well,[/strike] she was the most
beautiful woman of her time, said Mrs. Ramsay.
Somebody else was
that, said Mr. Ramsay.
?Nonsense
[strike]Nonsense[/strike]
Her daughter would be far more beautiful than she was,
said Mrs. Ramsay.
He could see no trace of that
[strike]whatever,[/strike] said Mr. Ramsay.
[strike]Andrew is[/strike] How proud [strike][?][/strike]
they would be when Andrew was Senior Wrangler, said
Mrs. Ramsay.
She had better not fix her [strike]heart[/strike] thoughts upon
that said Mr. Ramsay (But it was he who dreamt of it
all night long) she [strike]thought examinations so silly[/strike] -
not
He should look
at Prue
tonight then,
said Mrs.
Ramsay.
she thought examining boys [strike]simply[/strike] idiotic. [strike]But[/strike]
only that she

to do it.
229
Her folly really passed belief, said Mr. Ramsay. If Andrew got a
scholarship, either at Balliol or at Trinity it would be something
to be proud of. The idea of being proud of him because he got a
scholarship! - she was proud of him [strike]just[/strike] as he was.
Did he not think it very late - rather late, - for [strike]those[/strike] them
still
[strike]young people[/strike] to be out?

so
And he wished to tell her, when he was
walking on the terrace [strike]he thought she looked so sad.[/strike]
he did not like to see her looking [strike][?][/strike] - so - sad
   [strike]Oh[/strike] I was half asleep - woolgathering, she said.
& standing in the gap between the hot pokers they
looked at the Bay
231
he began again -
[strike]how[/strike] it had pained him - just now on the terrace - that she should look [strike]so[/strike] sad
[strike]sad;[/strike] But she was only woolgathering she said flushing a little, ?after
He did not like her
reading fairy tales to the children.
She should not look sad;
[strike]so[/strike]
not that he meant quite that
he repeated; but he did not mean

explain why she

why it pained him;

[strike]quite what he said,[/strike]
but [strike]that he could not[/strike]
She had not been
exactly sad.
Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought,
she would never have been thinking about such things -
There was the Lighthouse again, for they had reached the
red

& the
There were the sandhills. And there, on the left the

of

up almost
silver water which were held firm.
And all the
torture, all the vice, Mrs. Ramsay thought, looking
at the
town & thinking of the old woman dying there, had turned
to
silver lights; & there was nothing to mark all that [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]knew of[/strike] the poverty [strike]&[/strike] the vice & the hardness of their lives -
but those lights which, rising into the air, & suspended
soul
the
above the houses, [strike]marked[/strike] seemed like [strike]the net of a city[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]a symbol, a phantom;[/strike] the thing which rises from the
the little streets;
the hot bedrooms
[strike]body, & is as[/strike] like a [strike]net floating[/strike] a starry net floating
there to mark the position of the little town.
   There was no reason whatever to be anxious, said
Mr. Ramsay. At Andrews age, he used to walk all day
with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket.
Mrs. Ramsay said that
she
could [strike]quite[/strike] believe him capable of any
[strike]such[/strike]
absurdity.
He
was still capable of almost any absurdity. [strike]He had[/strike]
[strike]But she knew that he growing old. He & he[/strike][strike][/strike]
but
[strike]knew it,[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]would not allow it. He would not[/strike]
But H[strike]h[/strike]e
[strike]was[/strike] was nettled at the thought that he was growing old.
He [strike]would[/strike] could put a biscuit in his pocket, walk all

But he knew that he would never
do that again: & it annoyed
him;
it angered him; that
233
she did not even contradict him.
[strike]for[/strike]
She knew that it would never do it.
She prevented him; she restrained him. For years ago [strike]he had been[/strike]
before he married, he had been reckless. Had he cared then whether he had
sat down soaked to his bread & cheese? Had he cared [strike]for[/strike] how [strike]long he[/strike]
far he went, or [strike]how[/strike] whether he worked all night or not?

&
never a human
being to interrupt
you all day long.
Where you
could
[strike]There was the[/strike]
[strike]sea, breaking[/strike]
little sandy
beach where [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]even[/strike] no one had
been since the
beginning of the
world
There, on the far side of the bay, dwindling away into
darkness, w[strike]h[/strike]ere the sandhills. There was the lonely country
he loved best. [strike]Those h[/strike] with never a house or a signpost or a
village; nothing [strike]but tracks over the hills, & so that you[/strike]
walk a while day without meeting a soul.
[strike]And suddenly[/strike]

We know nothing, he [strike]sai[/strike] murmured
to himself, [strike]for[/strike] & seemed
to be
on the familiar [?] of the

We stand on the edge of a precipice [strike]looking into the abyss.[/strike]
in his abstraction
he murmured;
[strike]but[/strike]
without meaning it, he [strike]could[/strike] said [strike]the[/strike]
whispered
[strike]last words[/strike] "the edge of a precipice" above his breath; & instantly
repented. He had no right. She was there. The parents of eight
children, he [strike]recalled[/strike] recollected; of eight sons & daughters - &
[strike]had no[/strike] have no choice.
[u]They[/u] would see to it, he thought;
meaning that [strike]they at least[/strike] - his Andrew & his Prue & all
the rest of them, not least that obstinate little beggar James
[strike]with his[/strike] would somehow put off the day of reckoning
would [strike]stave[/strike] stem the flood a bit; [strike]would[/strike] were the best
token he could give - they could give - his wife & himself -
that they did not damn the poor little universe
entirely; [strike]this poor speck of matter; this little crag,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]with girt by floods;[/strike] for one reason why he loved [strike]Finlay was[/strike]
[strike]that[/strike] these remote islands was that [strike]this poor little island[/strike]
[strike]Indeed he could be[/strike]
They
[strike]It[/strike] had a pathetic smallness, on an
evening like this.
The little islands seemed [strike]vanish[/strike]
swallowed up in the sea.
"Poor little town", he murmured
looking at the village
   "On the edge of a precipice", Mr. Ramsay thought.
He said the most melancholy things & [strike]always[/strike] [strike]he,[/strike] she noticed,
always
directly he had said them, he was
particularly cheerful.
[strike]He seemed always to be playing a game[/strike] -
It was like a game
to him

[strike]But she liked his games[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]she & she believed in them odd[/strike]

[strike]as they were; she believed that he was[/strike]
[strike]And after all they[/strike]
[strike]agreed on the most important points.[/strike]

[strike]said, he should have shot himself long ago.[/strike]
[strike]But he as it was[/strike]
[strike]he seemed to become more cheerful.[/strike]
He ought to be ashamed of
himself, she said,
[strike]It was a[/strike] [strike]to stand there, on a night like this,[/strike]
[strike]to complain on a night like this,[/strike] to talk of precipices on a night
like this, & all the children well: & so good; & so full of promise.
237
They turned away from the view, & began to walk up the [strike]drive, w[/strike] path
[strike]which[/strike] was [strike]bordered with silvery green thick leaved plants,[/strike]
by the flower beds where they grew [strike]clumps of[/strike] spear like plants,

   Mr. Bankes was saying that he had been to Amsterdam. He
had seen the Rembrandts. He had been to Madrid. Unfortunately,
it was Good Friday, & he had not see the Prado.
He had been to
Rome. Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome? Oh she should
try to go to Rome. It would be a wonderful experience for her -
the Sistine Chapel; Michael Angelo: & Siena, with its [strike]car[/strike] Giottos.

in their unconsciousness - for they were looking at Prue throwing
catches - so awe inspiring & moving to the emotions, so that
Lily thought how she saw now what Mrs. Ramsay meant about

like effects, & for [strike]the[/strike] while [strike]the marine curiosities are equally[/strike]
[strike]they are remarkable for the[/strike] for the extent & variety of their
marine curiosities".
So [strike]quoting the guide book, & in[/strike]
[strike]the highest spirits[/strike] [strike]which roused Andrew's suspicions slightly,[/strike]
[strike]for there it would not do[/strike], [strike][/strike][strike]to this rout of shoutings[/strike]
But it would not do altogether, this shouting & damning your eyes,
Andrew felt: picking his way down the path in front of them;
[strike]the[/strike] & the sudden friendliness, the clapping him on the back, the
altogether do, was the worst of taking Rayley & Minta Doyle,
calling him old fellow, the laughing too
easily,
all this would not
on
in an expedition together.
So indeed, they separated;
it came about somehow. They said they were going to
explore
the caves; but as 'the marine curiosities for which these
islands are justly celebrated', are found only
[strike]out[/strike] on rocks
[strike]which the sea comes[/strike]
[strike]exposed to the[/strike] covered
at high tide,
he was not going in to the caves; but taking off
his socks he
out onto
rolled them up in his boots & set off barefoot;
[strike]over[/strike] the pope's nose
[strike]rocks.[/strike]
Nancy [strike]would follow[/strike]; [strike]but she[/strike] [strike]but first she[/strike] wanted [strike]to[/strike] first to
find shells; pointed shells [strike]with green[/strike] lights
in them to
[strike]stick on boxes;[/strike]
or glass; or veined stones; or cowries, perhaps,
for Cam's collection.
[strike]but she scrambled[/strike] too, to [strike]Andrew[/strike]
the [strike]big rock, wi[/strike]
[strike]Then, if Andrew did the Popes Nose, she would[/strike]
[strike]do the Devil's hoof -[/strike]
[strike]so they called it;[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] for
then she searched too
into the deep [strike]little[/strike] rock pools,
where the sea anemones
flowered, the red & the yellow,
streaming their tentacles in
the [strike]deep[/strike] current of the deep inland
sea, [strike]when[/strike] where swam the
whales & the sharks, she thought,
converting the pool into the
depths of the ocean;
covering its sky
with her hand so as to bring disaster -
desolation,
[strike]to its[/strike] & then uncovering it to the sun
beat down.
She

[strike]something extraordinary appeared,[/strike] wonderful ?marlins/?martins appeared - she shouted
for Andrew. He told her to mark the place: he would come over in
half a jiffy.
But they slid into crevices: ?scaled/?sealed ?marlins/?martins
all fresh & glowing with their extravagant eccentricity &
[strike]charm, something[/strike] fantastic & high stepping - they
shrank
silently
retreated, [strike]in[/strike] a
Nancy marking the crevice where he had disappeared,
watched from her rock that slightly irregular line of the
their highstepping
legs, their
fringes, their
gauntlets,
their [?]
?being
horizon: the waving the stems [strike]which[/strike]
that
were the smoke of steamers; & so
was overcome with the power of the waves, & their sullenness &
[strike]their indifference.[/strike]
[strike]As they she thought, nobody had ever been[/strike]
[strike]been[/strike] breaking round her. [strike]As she thought, this would go on;[/strike]
[strike]go on for ever & ever; the waves breaking, & swirling into the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]booming in the caves.[/strike]
Filled with scorn, & the
sweeping savagely up & then inevitably withdrawing.
As she thought, this would go on, go on for ever & ever. [strike]What[/strike]
   Andrew shouted to her to get back to the beach, as
the sea was coming in.
So she took off her shoes &
stockings; took off the shoes & stockings of this negligible &
phantom
evanescent
spirit; &
as she rolled the stockings & put
them in the
shoes, she felt the
sea in
her heart; the content of
in her veins
&
in her mind
the sea; & [strike]its[/strike]
the power of the sea; &
the nothingness [strike]of life; & her own[/strike]
power to [strike]ride the[/strike] [strike]bestride the universe;[/strike]
of the terror of life; & the
horror of life; & the life; & so stepped through the water on [strike]the[/strike] to
the shingle; & there - there they [strike]we behind the rock[/strike] kissing behind
Paul Rayley & Minta Doyle [strike]were[/strike] kissing.
And Andrew
fish
should, had she marked her [strike]rock[/strike]
& they went out
again to look for the fringed gauntletted, high stepping fish:
He had seen it too:
& seen enough.
They shared
the horror
in silence
It must have been some sort of crayfish he said.
He had
?But
too
some
He had seen it
too - people kissing - & so, [strike]letting[/strike]
[strike]after[/strike] as the fish would not come out, & they both felt
awkward, & silent, & the waves seemed to Nancy sullener than ever,
more tremendous. And
[strike]she had[/strike] against the waves she had the
pitted the ferocity of man;
the lust & the warmth;
the ravening & the cruelty: nothing
beautiful remained [strike]of it[/strike] of it.
255
Raw & protruberent the domes & pinnacles of life pricked through the mist. And yet
the waves splashed in; only the force wh. had been in them, was now
divided against them; there was doom, & there was effort. She was on
the side of the sea
   [strike]But what with[/strike] It was not [strike]late[/strike] [strike]so late when they got up[/strike]
[strike]again on to the cliff;[/strike] but [strike]to[/strike] until they got up again onto the cliff
that Minta discovered ?how she had lost her grandmother's
brooch. - Her grandmother's brooch - the sole ornament she
weeping willow
possessed. [strike]It was[/strike] a pearl brooch, oblong, set round a landscape
always
& her grandmother had worn it to
fasten her little
lace cap.
And she had lost it. Tears streamed from
her
eyes.
desperate, [strike]serious,[/strike] determined,
They all went back. Paul Rayley searched where they had been
sitting.
All this tension
& seriousness about a pearl brooch,
did not do at all, Andrew thought, compelled to [strike]be[/strike]
search thoroughly
"between that point & this [strike]point[/strike]" as
always till the
day she died
She burst into
tears
She implored them
to find it;
& Yet it was
half pleasure,
Nancy felt; she
?liked losing that ?brooch
wh.
was [?] [?]
There was not
the least danger
of that,
Now it was
?useless ?trying
?long,
& always
had found
things,
Paul Rayley said making a [strike]serious[/strike] perfect pother about it;
was coming in
And the sea would be in, over the place where they had
sat, would cover the whole rock;
"We shall be cut off"
cried
terrified;
said Minta suddenly -
as if there were any danger of
that;
[strike]But as Andrew[/strike]
as Andrew thought. [strike]Then[/strike]
&
& decided
The men took counsel together,
(Andrew became excessively manly)
then
Paul's stick
they would plant a stick on
the spot; & come back at dawn.
[strike]So Minta was told[/strike],
M
& still she
wept for the loss of her brooch &
wept, [strike]Nancy[/strike] & for some other loss [strike]she wept[/strike]; as Nancy felt; - &
Paul comforted her; saying that he would be [strike]up at dawn,[/strike]
[strike]would[/strike] tell the police about it, & be up at dawn, & this so
[strike]comfo[/strike] by degrees cheered Minta, & [strike]certainly[/strike] it
some
cheered Paul,
[strike]who[/strike] & slowly he began fingering [strike]those[/strike]
astonishing possessions -
life, & being loved, & telling people
about it.
& its being declared to the world; &
all he would do for her; &
being married; &
then children, & everything everything
always together - [strike]so he went on,[/strike] until he
had
no
257
notion what was happening to them exactly, or that the world could
contain such feelings as his.
To be believed in - & to be ?made ?one of:
[strike]to fin[/strike] he vowed he would be up at three & find her brooch, &

put it on her plate; & take the boat to Edinburgh & buy
another; [strike]or[/strike] [strike]somehow[/strike] prove to her what he could do for her.
[strike]And there[/strike] And this mingled with the [strike]sudden[/strike] sprinkled lights
coming out on the edge of the bay; bright, [strike]clear[/strike]
[strike]sparkling,[/strike] [strike]rippling[/strike] with
divine laughter
& constant joy -
light
this mingled with that, & again he thought, as the
?some
of the town on
the sea.
with [strike]great[/strike] high
[strike]?bushe[/strike] hedges
walking on & on
[strike]& on[/strike]
alone along the
road
they came out on the road [strike]of the[/strike] where it was lonely &
brown-shaded, how awful the retreat was into themselves,
into solitude, & bare existence together, [strike]man[/strike] two
human beings alone; [strike]passing[/strike] walking along this road.
But he would protect her; he would be up at dawn &
?would
find her brooch; & the one person
he [strike]would[/strike] tell was Mrs.
Ramsay. Yes,
Mrs. Ramsay. [strike]He would go straight[/strike] to her.
[strike][?][/strike] telling her was his
reward, for it had been positively
awful - asking Minta to marry him: far the worst
[strike]thing he had ever[/strike] done in his life: it was far worse than
but
any examination: &
he had won. [strike]And[/strike]
[strike]?he would tell[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay.
Tears rose in his eyes. He knew why
Minta had not been
crying for her
brooch ?if he
knew.
Minta had cried. [strike]It is[/strike] half pain, he noted; this
[strike]extreme[/strike] happiness is the most serious
thing in the whole
?but happy in
It was all
world
Was it not through
Mrs. Ramsay who [strike]was the[/strike]
[strike]It is[/strike]
had come to him?
[strike]She had[/strike]
Mrs. Ramsay who [strike]was the[/strike]
had taught him how feelings - how one may have feelings - She
[strike]had them[/strike] these queer feelings - She had them, he knew; &
her eyes
He had felt her eyes on
him all day long:
[strike]she was the[/strike]
presiding saint
One had saints.
[strike]But[/strike] Could one tell her
an
odious
what she had done for him
- [strike]a stubborn[/strike]
little [strike]ass[/strike], [strike]of n[/strike]
man
[strike]thinking no end of himself,[/strike]
& no one caring a straw for him,
until she took him up -
All that was good in
both of them they owed -
Minta owed it too. And

following him;
resting on him -
he cd. ?himself
259
so they reached the lane up to Finlay: [strike]It was awfully late, probably.[/strike]
[strike]One could tell that by the lights in the bedroom windows.[/strike]
& it must be late, with the lights in the windows.
Burn, he said;
blaze; make a hole in the the night, [strike]brave lights;[/strike] & they were
eyes
her eyes, [strike]only[/strike] & her childrens,
[strike]burning on in all their chambers[/strike]; &
which seemed to him [strike]to[/strike] burning there, blazing there. But
goodness knew, he
didn't want to make
a fool of himself.

March 5th
[u]XIV[/u]
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
   Well, then, [strike]she supposed,[/strike] Nancy had gone with them; Mrs. Ramsay
supposed, wondering, as she [strike]surv[/strike] [strike]considered[/strike] [strike]which[/strike] put down a
brush, took up a comb, & said 'Come in' to [strike]the little[/strike]
a tap at the door, (Timothy & Rose came in) whether the fact that
Nancy was with them made it less likely that anything would
less
happen: anyhow it was
[strike]not[/strike] likely that four people
would be drowned [strike]at once[/strike]
than
   three
   Timothy & Rose said
Mildred wanted to know whether she
should wait dinner.
   "Not for the Queen of England" said Mrs. Ramsay
emphatically.
   "Not for the Emperor of Mexico" she added.
And if Timothy liked, while Rose took the message, he might
choose which jewel she was to wear; for after all, where
there are fifteen people sitting
down to dinner, it is [strike]quite[/strike]
out of the question waiting - keeping
things hot is tiresome
enough. And it seemed to Mrs. Ramsay,
now that she was active,
that these people were only inconsiderate,
not tragic,
thinking
it did not matter
how late they
were,
[strike]nothing mattered,[/strike] though, in fact,
she particularly wished dinner to
be
nice, with [strike]Mr.[/strike] William Bankes dining with them; & to
show him she did know how to cook vegetables, she was
[strike]having one course entirely[/strike] having [strike]special[/strike] vegetables specially
[strike]a[/strike] too
?a ?la
done for him, &
Boeuf [strike]a la[/strike] au Daube, which had been
been weighing on
Mildred's spirits all day.
You
stand it in water for twenty four
hours: you [strike]add[/strike] stir
continuously; you add a little
bay leaf, & then a
dash of sherry:
the whole [strike]being[/strike]
never [strike]been[/strike] being
allowed,
of course, to come to the boil.
[strike]If they kept[/strike]
[strike]dinner waiting[/strike]
[strike]after all that, it would be most unfair upon[/strike]
[strike]Mildred.[/strike]
And then, tonight of all nights, they
263
late.
offered
an opal
Timothy [strike]would have liked[/strike] her to wear a gold necklace: Rose

an
gold
[strike]wanted her opal[/strike]
necklace;
Which did look best against her black
dress?
Which did indeed, said Mrs. Ramsay absent mindedly,
allowing her children to rummage among her things, while she
looked at a sight which always amused
her, the rooks
to decide
trying which tree to
settle on;
Everytime they changed their minds,
& rose into the air again,
[strike]whether[/strike]
because, she thought, the old
[strike]troubl[/strike]
rook, the old father rook, was
of [strike]an unsettled disposition.[/strike]
troublesome.
   Look, she said laughing.
Weren't the old birds actually
fighting?
[strike]quarelling?[/strike] Anyhow up they
all went again; & the air
was
cut into exquisite scimitar shapes;
the movement of the wings [strike]was[/strike]
beating out, out, out, was one
of the [strike]sights[/strike] loveliest of all
sights[strike][/strike][strike]: she[/strike] to her, in the pale sky
   But which was it to be? They had all the
trays of her old jewel case
open; the gold, which was Italian:
the opal, which Uncle
James gave her; or should she wear her
[strike]old[/strike] amythysts?
She let the children choose; she let Rose
try this that & the other, Rose who
was so horribly bad at her
sums, Mrs. Ramsay said; but
this little ceremony of choosing
jewels was, Mrs. Ramsay
half suspected [strike]only[/strike] perhaps not even
half, for there were[strike],[/strike]
in
her relations
with her children,
always hidden pockets
of emotion, [strike]which[/strike]
which she never examined,
a consolation
to Rose;
this choosing jewels was [strike]rather a serious[/strike] to [strike]poor[/strike] that
[strike]woolgathering[/strike]
[strike]dear[/strike]
[strike]tri[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]scatterbrained, silent child,[/strike]
[strike]who[/strike]
[strike]wished, passionately[/strike]
[strike]that her mother shd. wear the gold necklace, that she should[/strike]
[strike]fasten it, & should thus have one[/strike]
[strike]She loved the colours, seeing how things went, you 'white[/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]The[/strike]
[strike]a ceremony[/strike]
to Rose; something she liked for
standing
to let her
but
were
hidden reasons,
what reasons, Mrs. Ramsay wondered,
[strike]thinking[/strike]
change the
necklace,
sadly of [strike]her[/strike] all the things one could not know. [strike]Was she[/strike]
divining, through her own past
[strike]the[/strike] some deep, some
but
not
buried, some
?anguished love, & [strike]not[/strike]
thinking
of it as love for -

herself; nor was it perhaps,
love of herself
[strike]but[/strike] [strike]for to Rose[?][/strike] [strike]but[/strike] for
but a love, so
natural as
?must ?not
?question
it;
265
was rather love of a voice, love of a face, love of a principle, almost, of
motherhood holding its children maternally, & womanhood, in its
valiancy, & [strike]the[/strike] [strike]of the[/strike] desire, passionate beyond telling,
a glan&lt;ce&gt;
to attract [strike]to he[/strike] [strike]one[/strike]
herself [strike]one[/strike] glance, one caress,
or the [strike]tenderness[/strike]
approval [strike]& underst[/strike] of eyes which suddenly, in the strangest way,
could bestow upon Rose heavenly bliss.
[strike]During[/strike]
Now
267
[strike]IX[/strike]
[u]XV[/u]
   "[strike]But[/strike] What have I done with my life?"
thought
[strike]said[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay
taking her place at the head of the long table. "William
sit by me," she said. Lily there..."
[strike]For some reason she[/strike]
[strike]could not[/strike]
[strike]They had[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] [strike]For it was all over.[/strike]
They had
an
that
their moment.
?She this: infinitely long, narrow,
white table; with
& a heap of
empty places; plates:
At the far end was her
husband. [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]who might say nothing from start to finish.[/strike]
[strike][?][/strike] sitting down
with a
shake of the head, a
sigh.
She had felt a great deal of emotion: she now felt

none whatever; nothing but [strike]that[/strike]
a
curious sense of being
she was
They had
borne on, because things were stronger
than oneself:
'that'; [strike]lost[/strike] [strike]what w[/strike] 'that' which
finally landed one in long tables, &
piles of plates.
[strike]A most curious sensation; to be[/strike] & that
would change presumably to this.
And for a moment
she had a curious sense of being
past everything, through everything;
out of everything; as they handed the soupplates; so that,
[strike]having the[/strike] being [strike]relieved of her burden,[/strike] [strike]she could say,[/strike] [strike]Well[/strike]
[strike]then what have I done with my life?[/strike]
[strike]But of course,[/strike]
what have I done, she would ask;
[strike]for as it was[/strike]
[strike]certain that she had[/strike]
& wait (while they came in, one after another, Charles Tansley,
Mr. Carmichael, [strike][?][/strike]) wait, passively, for somebody or other to
or for
[strike]give her[/strike] an answer; [strike]for[/strike] something
[strike]or other[/strike] to happen.
[strike]Only[/strike]
But [strike]this was not being sad.[/strike] And [strike]if they knew what[/strike]
But this is not a thing, she thought, ladling out another plate
for someone, [strike]to tell[/strike] that one says;
   [strike]Lily, she thought to herself would have been an admirable old[/strike]
[strike]maid.[/strike]
[strike]One does not say it to Lily, she thought.[/strike]
And smiling
ironically at [strike]her own[/strike] the discrepancy -
that was what she
ladling out
was thinking & this was what she was doing -
helping
soup:
she felt begin in her, like a [strike]stream or a [?][/strike] like the pulse of some
machine which stopped for a moment begins inexplicably to
work, the old familiar life again: & [strike]soo[/strike] so on; she thought,
269
remembering how long people lived & how they enjoyed it, & so on; &
so on, she repeated, ironically, cautiously sheltering this still feeble pulse,
which she must encourage, for form's sake; or how should she get
through dinner.
[strike]The truth of it is of course, she thought,[/strike]
And so on
she said, very nearly aloud this time, addressing herself to William Bankes,
who had been through it all;
Dear William Bankes: poor William
Bankes, for after all it must
be better dining up here than alone in
lodgings!
And at that moment,
cautiously in her pity for him, &
a [strike]new[/strike] life began; & she
noticed it, not without weariness,
though
anything else would have been
intolerable;
noticed it, as
the sailor see his
sail fill out; & [strike]we[/strike] knows himself off now:
& with this wind in her
sails, Mrs. Ramsay too
[strike]in one second would be off[/strike] was off -
And yet the strangeness remained;
271
like an ?outcast; [strike]like the[/strike] as if a shade had fallen, & robbed of colour
she saw things truly; & then, not of her own willing, but
independently
like the pulse of a machine, which, inexplicably stopped, inexplicably
begins again, the old
familiar life began [strike]beating.[/strike] And so on
& so on, she thought, mechanically,
[strike]as if she too[/strike]
thinking how
one, two,
three,
irrationally.
long peoples lives are & how much on the whole
they seem to
enjoy them).
And so on & so on, she repeated,
cautiously
fostering
sheltering & furthering the still feeble pulse,
[strike]so[/strike] as one
might guard a weak flame with a newspaper [strike])[/strike]
And so on,
she concluded, [strike]finding her life in her now almost[/strike] strong enough.
addressing herself, by bending slightly in his direction, to
who
William Bankes, - poor man!
[strike]He[/strike] had no wife, no children,
to bear her on again
[strike]&[/strike] in pity for him, life being now
strongly enough established,
she [strike]said[/strike] began again, all this
[strike]being[/strike] business,
[strike]as a sailor[/strike]
sees [strike]the wind[/strike]
not without weariness,
as a sailor see the
wind fill his sail, &
yet hardly wants to be off again;
how the ?boat
thinks
[strike]for a moment how the boat[/strike]
had it sunk, [strike]might have[/strike]
[strike]the boat[/strike] might have [strike]plunged[/strike] him to the depths of the sea.
[strike]taken[/strike]
whirled him
down & down
[strike]w[/strike] to the
depths
of the
sea.
[strike]"Well,[/strike] [strike]she said; to William,[/strike] Did [strike]they[/strike] you find your
she said
letters.
I told them to put them in the hall for you."
   Lily Briscoe noticed it - her ?drifting/?dipping into that [strike]odd[/strike]
strange no man's land, where following
is
impossible, [strike]& only[/strike]
[strike]some[/strike]
& [strike]one resents the[/strike] &
[strike]as some[/strike] & yet
to let them [strike]go &[/strike]
leave us is
intolerable; [strike]so[/strike]
so that Lily thought, seeing
how old
she
Mrs. Ramsay ladling out soup,
[strike]that she looked[/strike]
[strike]older than[/strike]
[strike]she should look,[/strike] [strike][/strike][strike]& then, for[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]more[/strike]
how old she
(resenting it)
looked; how worn she looked;
how stern; & then,
when she
turned to William Bankes,
Lily thought, with [strike]some[/strike]
amusement, why does she pity him?
For that was
the impression she gave, when she told him about his
letters; [strike]that[/strike]
Poor William Bankes, she seemed to be saying.
273
as if her own weariness which was so visible came from pity; & the
life in her were stirred by pity. And it was not true, Lily thought.
[strike]But then[/strike] Mr. Bankes was perfectly happy she was sure. He
had his work.
[strike]But then[/strike] Lily felt [strike]every[/strike] [strike]that everyone was[/strike]
very sure:
Lily felt, [strike]The wonderful[/strike]
[strike]thing about life is this:[/strike]
may
[strike]how[/strike] one [strike]thinks its like this: when, as a matter of fact,[/strike]
[strike]it is not like this:[/strike] I [strike]now know where[/strike] I shall put the [strike]light there[/strike]
tree rather further [strike]over; & so[/strike] to the middle: Then I shall
avoid that break, which is [strike]I'm sure now,[/strike] what was puzzling me [?] ?sure
She would do that first thing next morning. And
never
   [strike]How seldom[/strike] one gets anything by the post [strike]that is[/strike]
really worth having [strike]said Mr. Bankes.[/strike]
[strike]Yet[/strike] Yet one always
wants [strike]lett[/strike] one's letters, said Mr. Bankes.
that is
[strike]He[/strike]
[strike]Wat[/strike]
   [strike]But[/strike] What rot they talked, what rot,
thought Charles Tansley [strike]who had[/strike] laying down his spoon
cleaned
in the middle of his plate precisely, having [strike]eaten[/strike] [strike]swept[/strike] it
perfectly [?] bare.
was
determined to
make
as if, Lily thought, (he was precisely
opposite her) he [strike]was made[/strike] sure of his meals; [strike]as if[/strike] he
of any sort
had not an ounce of generosity over.
There he would sit,
in his pepper & salt coat & grey flannel trousers, eating his
all
& [?]
all
which
way through the meal like a cockchafer;
bristly, [strike]?packing[/strike]
now;
And Mrs. Ramsay would pity him: she pitied men, always;
never women.
[strike]Still[/strike]
Poor Charles Tansley - that was
precisely what Mrs. Ramsay was thinking. [strike]Poor litt little man[/strike]
[strike]For[/strike] He was not a gentleman:
[strike]No.[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley was[/strike]
[strike]thinking how he could never ?say ?thing about like that[/strike]
No.
He had
[strike]no conv[/strike]
nothing to say.
[strike]He was uneasy.[/strike]
What could she say
to make him feel easy?
Did you notice the lovely
light
But
[strike]Well,[/strike] he would not be made easy;
[strike]he would not talk[/strike]
[strike]nonsense,[/strike] [strike]Charles Tansley thought.[/strike]
He would not talk nonsense.
For having finished the second volume of
Sorel's history of the
French Revolution, & sandwiched in a chapter of Meredith,
(this was more than he had bargained for, too)
Charles
in the ?world
Tansley
was rather up in
his
own estimation;
had
that
not?envious [strike]of[/strike]
lacking small talk was
any drawback.

come down stairs on the stroke of eight, & [strike]from that[/strike] here they were,
two silly women making men talk rot. He despised women;
not in the foolish way of a boy; but as men despise them.
[strike]He[/strike] If it were not for women, the world would have been civilised
centuries ago.
In every age they are the great hindrance to
proper
free thought, & [strike]responsible[/strike] life.
[strike]Some[/strike] ages have idealised them.
Now vaunting themselves the equals of men they will now
But
have to face frank criticism.
[strike]Unfortunately,[/strike] with minds of
wax, they will never face anything.
There [strike]was[/strike] [strike]little[/strike] no
is
chance of going to the lighthouse, [strike]he was afraid,[/strike] Charles
turning in his chair
Tansley said.
[strike]Were the[/strike] Why, then,
did one mind
what he
said, Lily Briscoe
wondered.
[strike]for[/strike]
[strike]being so[/strike] insignificant as he was!
O its Shakespeare, she corrected herself - as a forgetful ?person,
entering [strike]Hyde Park,[/strike] Regents Park, [strike]might wonder why[/strike] & seeing
the Park keeper was coming towards her menacingly;
[strike]they make on[/strike] [strike]dogs must be on a lead;[/strike]
might exclaim
of course
Oh I remember dogs must be on a lead!
So Lily Briscoe
remembered that [strike]everyon[/strike] [strike]man[/strike] has Shakespeare [strike]behind him;[/strike]
women have not.
&
[strike]We are not so nearly so clever as[/strike]
how men
have that
behind them;
& women
nothing.
[strike]they are, she thought, & therefore I must[/strike]
What then could she
say? [strike]to[/strike] inferior as she was; &
was it not much easier to be
inferior after all? -
That is the whole secret of art, she
not for oneself
thought to herself.
To care for the thing: what does it matter
& did she mind
being inferior,
did she feel, on
the whole
inferior? -
whether I succeed or not?
And joyous as she was tonight,
about her picture, she [strike]abased h[/strike] was very very nice, to
Charles Tansley. She was[strike],[/strike] a charming creature, [strike]Lily;[/strike]
her Lily; Mrs. Ramsay thought
Without any
striking charm, without any of the glow that made one
notice Minta directly she came [strike]into a room[/strike],
in
Lily had qualities that would
She could

wanted

But did one not always like people
when one looked at them?
grey blue
She must admit that his eyes were good: he had honest eyes.
   "Do you write many letters, Mr. Tansley?" said
Mrs. Ramsay pitying him too, Lily supposed; for that was true
of Mrs. Ramsay: she pitied men always as if they lacked
& never
never
something; [strike]nev[/strike] [strike]not[/strike] [strike]she did[/strike] not pity women, as if they had
something. Yet it was the other way round; women had nothing
power
men everything - [strike]considered[/strike]
for the material point of view,
office,
But
it was very like
[strike]everything[/strike] were
so much
easier
men
for
money, education; & so on.
[strike]men had all that instantly.[/strike]
[strike]It all[/strike],
it was part of
Mrs. Ramsay
   He wrote to his mother; but otherwise he did not write
to anybody, Mr. Tansley said
   For he was not going to talk the sort of rot these people
wanted him to talk. Having finished [strike]his ch vo[/strike] vol
two of Sorel before dinner, he had wedged in a chapter of
Harry Richmond & was not going to be condescended to by
these upper middle class women;
[strike][?][/strike]
whom he despised.
[strike]What[/strike]
[strike]did they know of anything?[/strike]
"One never gets anything worth having by
he ?should [?] in
worth having
the post" - that was true.
They never got anything from one
years end to another. They [strike]exist[/strike] live the most useless of lives;
[strike]&[/strike]
[strike]His own mother did more[/strike]
[strike]They did not know the[/strike]
with
[strike]meaning of work.[/strike] talk, talk, talk; other women waiting on
them; & [strike]they despised[/strike]
It was women who made civilisation impossible.
He despised women more & more.
   "No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs.
Ramsay" he said, half turning in his chair, as if to
confirm his [strike]weath[/strike] forecast.
[strike]of the weather[/strike].
   He was really,
Lily Briscoe thought, the most
uncharming human being 
she had ever met.
[strike]And so[/strike]
Why, then,
did one mind
what he said?
Oh, she remembered,
Shakespeare - that is to say, she had momentarily forgotten in
[strike]in her own elation,[/strike] [strike]how wo[/strike] about women not being
creative, & men being creative; & Charles Tansley therefore
being quite within his rights when he [strike]told[/strike] maintained that
to talk down to her; to say what was the use of her ?painting?
279
They could not paint or write or do anything ever: so that, being a man,
one had to respect him. [strike]All[/strike] She had clean forgotten. Now, she said looking at him,
now
to herself; [strike]lets have[/strike] it over;
meaning that [strike]now[/strike] she would now
descend to the [strike]caves[/strike] bottom of despair & let the [strike]dark[/strike] waves of humility
break; [strike]&[/strike] Then [strike]she would[/strike] come up cringing.
Down she went;
horror & despair; annihilation; nonentity; sure enough, they arched
their backs &
crashed over her; [strike]stooping form,[/strike] & yet - & yet. Opening her eyes
in the pale world of daylight again, she was aware of some
[strike]profound[/strike] [strike]small[/strike] trophy retrieved [strike]down[/strike] there; some talisman she
would sew to the inside of her dress (how [strike]the[/strike] [strike]it is[/strike] things themselves

i[strike]ndeed ever lasting;[/strike] [strike]how how[/strike] nothing else

[strike]she[/strike] was so [strike]joyous[/strike]
in her freedom
& did not the position of the
salt cellar mark something

He should have married a working class woman - for it irked him;
here he was staying with them; & he had no change of clothes for
the evening. He [strike]?to[/strike] did not know the sort of things they talked about -
like this "one never gets anything worth having by the post."

what Lily
Briscoe felt:

Mr. Tansley.

dissertations, & it was all very well for her, with two hundred a

But for
A strong young man - here she was again, [strike]just[/strike] saying
things she did not believe
in the least: but she did mean to

   "Yes. Take it away" said Mrs. Ramsay, briefly.
[strike]For[/strike]
It must have been twenty years ago [strike]that[/strike] or almost, that
she had stayed with
the Careys;

everything was still

Oh she could remember it
as if it were yesterday.
She could remember a picnic on a
bank. It was one of those chilly April days when most people
prefer to stay in doors. The Careys, however, once they made a
plan, stuck to it.
[strike]There was[/strike] It was very very cold. [strike]Hebe[/strike]

   [strike]After all, Mr. Bankes said,[/strike]

How strange - they were alive.
For Mrs. Ramsay [strike]con[/strike] found it
very difficult to think that the Careys would have been living all
this time, without her thinking of them. How full, how eventful,
her own life had been,
these last [strike]twenty years[/strike], fifteen years:

[strike]It seemed to her quite impossible that[/strike] Mrs. Carey [strike]had[/strike]

   "People soon drop out" said William Bankes humorously;
guessing Mrs. Ramsays thought. He [strike]did a[/strike] could not help
feeling a little gratified. Here was he, knowing them both;
he stayed with the Ramsays:
he stayed with the Careys.
That seemed to show that he moved in more circles than one.
[strike]That seemed to show that he had kept[/strike]

He was a little
amused; & gratified too; for did he not know
the
Ramsays & the Careys?
[strike]He knew them both.[/strike]

it not seem to give him a superiority - &, he reflected,
&
made a point
[strike]D[/strike] [strike]He[/strike] [strike]wa[/strike] moved in more circles than one, he thought,
approvingly; [strike]laying down his spoon. He[/strike] [strike][?[/strike]] [strike]h[/strike] [strike]y[/strike]
nobody could say that he had got into groove; & thus

He was not going to talk the rot these people wanted him to talk.

Tansley asked himself, turning in

amused that Mrs. Ramsay should be so astonished at Mrs. Careys
continued existence, gratified that he was the link between them.
[strike]He knew[/strike] them both; he had not drifted apart, he thought,
laying down his spoon & wiping his clean shaved lips punctiliously,
But perhaps he was rather unusual [strike]in this[/strike] he thought,
in this, that he never let himself get into a groove.
He [strike]never[/strike] had friends in all circles -
[strike]But[/strike] the [strike]nat[/strike]
reason why he preferred dining alone was to avoid the kind of
wait whic was [strike]inevitable[/strike]
unavoidable in a [strike]family[/strike] party

They kept one waiting while they changed the plates.
Mrs. Ramsay had to break off & tell the maid something.

[strike]For say what one will, work is the great pleasure[/strike]
[strike]in life: the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]great excitement: The poets talk of life being short. work is[/strike]
[strike]the great excitement;[/strike] Indeed,
all these things waste time.
Well, thought Mr. Bankes, preserving
a demeanuor of [strike]the[/strike]
exquisite courtesy, & merely spreading
the fingers of his left
hand on the tablecloth, as a mechanic
examines a
tool which is beautifully polished &

?After
[strike]He spent[/strike] 20 minutes over dinner, [strike]at home.[/strike] Then he was free to
[strike]work.[/strike] had he been alone, he would then have been free to work.
Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time. [Why, some of the
children are not down yet - [strike]Nor could they they begin again[/strike]

"I wish one of you would run up to
Roger's room" Mrs. Ramsay was saying - ] [strike]only[/strike] & [strike]yet[/strike]
he
respected & admired the Ramsays, & yet, he thought, even so,
[strike]how pale this is,[/strike] how trifling this is - [strike]as a[/strike] how boring this is -
for had he been free, he would have [strike]done nothing but[/strike] read - [strike]But[/strike]
[strike]how could he think of his work now? - with sitting beside[/strike]
[strike]Mrs. Ramsay? All[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]He admired them; he was very[/strike][strike][/strike]
by way of being an [strike]old[/strike] friend, all that: but
Mrs. Ramsay was thinking of something else.
And in the
shade of her presence, which prevented
him of course from fixing
his mind upon any regrets of his
own, he [strike]thought[/strike] [strike]with[/strike]
compared the excitement & the
pleasure & the sense of being
part of eternity (for ?in working
time seemed to have no
existence) [strike]& he[/strike]
which he would have had, had he been alone,
he compared that intensity that
excitement
which he had
putting
away
foregone, with this - this miserable
suspension of all
activity; [strike]this[/strike] [strike]& then[/strike] this sitting about drumming ones
fingers on the table. This cynicism - yes, for what [strike]did[/strike]
do human relationships amount to then?
There are
the [strike]Careys & the Ramsays.[/strike]
I am by way of being
[strike]a great[/strike] devoted to her, he thought. Yet Mrs.
Ramsay meant nothing to him, nothing, he thought,
stari&lt;ng&gt;
[strike]glaring[/strike]
[strike]from his blue eyes[/strike]
[strike]so hopelessly[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] blankly:
293
[strike]& yet she was only two feet away from him.[/strike]
   [strike]Indeed it was his conviction that[/strike]
   The [strike]passion[/strike] [strike]Preserved as he was by[/strike] He seldom thought about [strike]the[/strike]
such things: he was not a poet, not a novelist; his interest in life was
purely scientific. Just every now & then - if he was put out by
something - he asked himself questions like this: What should we say
if we were honest? Is human life a good thing, or ?it is it a bad
thing?
Why do we desire the continuance of the human race
upon earth?
What do we live for?
Such questions never
occurred to him at other times.
He was

   "I [strike]must[/strike] am so sorry" said Mrs. Ramsay; who had
been giving instructions of some sort.
For

Yet
She is one of my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to her
But
he thought. [strike]And yet[/strike]
her presence meant nothing to him: her beauty
by himself
meant nothing to him:
he wished only to be alone; & so
relieved from the disagreeable
necessity of realising
that he
had no feeling whatever for his friends:
His work was what he
to be alone &
able to work:
wanted. [strike]In default of[/strike] Work [strike]being impossible,[/strike] [strike]?there[/strike] But he must
sit here, drumming his fingers on the table, & feeling
uncomfortable because of his treachery - that
he was not
that he felt nothing for his
[strike]that it was all[/strike]
friends
enjoying himself, able to feel anything:
[strike]tasteless & insipid;[/strike]
He did not enjoy family life.
And
it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself [strike]those[/strike]
[strike]such questions as[/strike] - What do we live for? Why do we
desire the continuance of the human race? - questions
one asked
oneself,
which never occurred [strike]normally;[/strike] [strike]but were[/strike] [strike]One never thought[/strike]
[strike]about it,[/strike] if one was occupied. But [strike]sometimes[/strike] one could
not escape that sort of thing; especially when, as now,

to one; [strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay had forgotten Mrs.
Carey; [strike]that[/strike] he [strike]?himself felt nothing for Mrs. Ramsay[/strike] -
[strike]sitting though he was a few inches from her, &[/strike]
sat a few inches off Mrs. Ramsay, & was indifferent to her.
   "I am so sorry" said Mrs. Ramsay who had giving
been
instructions
of some sort.

which had been soaked

[strike]that would[/strike] be [strike]very[/strike]
painful, very painful.
   How you must regret
dining in this bear
garden said Mrs. Ramsay:
297
when
she had a social manner [strike]sometimes[/strike], she was a little distracted.
as, [strike]in[/strike] when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting, the chairman,
in order to [strike]unify the[/strike] obtain unity, [strike]drops into[/strike] [strike]French.[/strike]
suggests that everyone shall speak French. Perhaps it is bad French;
French may not contain the words necessary for the speaker's
thoughts; [strike]nevertheless,[/strike] but speaking French [strike]nevertheless[/strike]
imposes some order, some uniformity.
Replying to her in
the same language, Mr. Bankes said [strike]that[/strike]
"Not at all. [strike]Not at all[/strike]"

Mr. Tansley had no

It is a [strike]terrible[/strike] [strike]exhibition[/strike] expedition.

There was Mr. Langley last year. He
[strike]had[/strike] crossed the

but
he [strike]had[/strike] never
suffered as he did when my husband took him there, -
Are you a

[strike]good sailor,[/strike] Mr. Tansley?" she asked.
   [strike]So Lily in her[/strike] Indeed [strike][?][/strike] he was: but in his desire to make out

to cleave with a hammer

the impalpable impediments [strike]of this[/strike]

And that would lead to
his grandfather being a fisherman; to his
being self taught; to his
being the first of his family to obtain a university education;
to his being glad of it;
to his being Charles Tansley in
short - [strike]who was not even realised in this room &[/strike]
which nobody in this room seemed to realise. [strike]And yet[/strike] [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]he felt[/strike] Everybody here [strike]will be glad to say[/strike] that they know me
in ten years time, he thought, & felt almost pity; for
as a grain of dynamite laid beneath [?] bales of wool
apples & ?hid
& barrels of
comfortable clothing & food, might pity the
ignorance [strike]of[/strike]

For he would blow them all

[strike]He was[/strike] going [strike]to leave[/strike] his mark on the world.

her arch rather kittenish way?

life will run upon the rocks & indeed there is only

the scrunching & my nerves are tight as

said all [strike]do[/strike] this, as her tone said it, of course, for the fiftieth time, Lily
Briscoe had to renounce that experiment - [strike]of[/strike] [strike]how[/strike] what happens if

[strike]burden of egotism;[/strike] & he [strike]was[/strike] started [strike]telling her[/strike] [strike]talking to her about[/strike]
[strike]himself; & then[/strike] about [strike]Lighthouse, which[/strike] & told her how he had [strike]da[/strike]

   Lily Briscoe thought, feeling Mrs. Ramsays relief, But what
haven't I paid to get ?it ?you?
A sort of sincerity, she meant, has
been lost.
And [strike]she thought[/strike] her eye
caught the salt cellar &
she remembered with a shock of exquisite relief how [strike]that[/strike]

next morning she would move the
tree in her picture slightly to the right.
[strike]How could she[/strike]

"But how long do they leave [strike]a man[/strike] alone on a lighthouse?" she
asked.
   Mrs. Ramsay wished to talk about the Careys again;
to enter that dreamland, that unreal land, where the trees stood
stock still, & there was no haste -

a sort of humour
a pity
from knowing
what had

where everything had [strike]already[/strike] happened;

all the worries that had
assailed her then were solved;

terrifyingly over an abyss into unknown lands was sealed up
[strike]safe &[/strike] ran its
course [strike]safe[/strike] [strike]between banks.[/strike]
equally
to re-enter all

She wished to talk of all
that; [strike]but that[/strike]

[strike]Like so many other things;[/strike]
[strike]but it was[/strike]
[strike]twitched away.[/strike]
[strike]She knew it.[/strike]
but [strike]no: it[/strike] had floated from her.
[strike]The mood had gone.[/strike]
[strike]Mr.[/strike] William Bankes was not in the mood
[strike][/strike][strike]But then he should be in the mood. But what was[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]it that she did?[/strike]

   "The children are [strike]quite[/strike] disgraceful" she said.

He replied something
about punctuality being one
of the [strike]vir[/strike] minor virtues which we
do not acquire until later in life.
   [strike]Mrs. Ramsay knew quite well, & Mr. Bankes knew quite well[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]that here was a horrid affair: that they were at loggerheads.[/strike]
   "If at all" said Mrs. Ramsay, merely to fill up space.

And conscious
of his treachery, conscious of her desire for
thing else from
these
some [strike]more[/strike] [strike]intimate talk,[/strike]
This perfunctory
words
if at all,
feel
?profoundly,
that he
[strike]seemed[/strike] [strike]seemed vain[/strike] & made Mr. Bankes [strike]a[/strike]
pity her; &
[strike]then[/strike] But what was he to do?
What were they to say?
What were other people saying?
[strike]W[/strike] Surely one
305
catch some line thrown from the other [strike]end of the table?[/strike] Lily &
Mr. Tansley were talking about the fishing industry; [strike]They were[/strike]
& [strike]emigration.[/strike]
[strike]They were[/strike]
&
talking about emigration.
[strike]All that,[/strike]
& that was all so admirable - that [strike]the[/strike] facts should be
discussed & injustice exposed;
that the failure of some
[strike][?][/strike] men to [strike]bring in[/strike] make enough to live
on this year should be
deplored, & the pressure
which drove them to America
should be denounced; but honestly, what was lacking? [strike]in[/strike]
[strike]Why[/strike] [strike]Some[/strike] [strike]The usual thing.[/strike]
Already bored, Lily Bankes
knew that something was lacking; William Bankes catching on to
Tansleys last words "one of the most scandalous acts of the
present government" knew that something was lacking.
[strike]And[/strike]
The usual
Only [strike]this: that no[/strike]
[strike]Some[/strike] profound unreality had
mixed itself in; & bending themselves to listen to the
tale of suffering & injustice,
what they felt was, pray
not be seen
Heaven that the inside of my mind may
never be exposed to view
for I am [strike]fo[/strike] lying.

their [strike]interest,[/strike]
their pity,

hoping that they
were separate)
[strike]attent[/strike] time, attention; but who of all those
Always they had
all felt this: when
it came to
the suffering of the poor: to the
vast waves that desolate whole countrysides - to eruptions
of earthquakes; to the tyranny & injustice (how naturally
the words ran into absurd rhetorical couples which one
would be ashamed to feel on one's own lips!)
then,
secretly, they had all felt [strike]this[/strike] the same discomfort &
at

[strike]depression,[/strike] their
own unworthiness, of their own
cynicism; & giving their names or time or money to the
cause or the fund, each
had come away with the same
dissatisfaction
[strike]sense of profound unreality.[/strike]
[strike]feeling:[/strike] [strike]conscio[/strike]
they had been
deceived
   But, perhaps, thought Mr. Bankes, as he
this
looked at Mr.
Tansley, he is the man.
[strike]He gav[/strike]
There was always the chance
it
them always the
benefit of the doubt.
At any moment the
307
leader
sincere man may arise: the man of genius, the great man. [strike]Moreover,[/strike]
Probably he will be
excessively disagreeable to us old fogies, thought
Mr. Bankes. Unkempt, ill-mannered all of that. [strike]And[/strike]
[strike]But after he had listened to Tansley talking, again the unreality[/strike]
But - here Mr. Bankes came to the usuall conclusion; Mr.
what he did not know
not
Tansley could tell him [strike]nothing[/strike]
[strike]that he did not[/strike] know already.
He [strike]w[/strike] abused the Government. Perfectly justly no doubt. But
Mr. Bankes himself could abuse the government. [strike]In all the[/strike]
It is not abuse that is wanted, Mr. Bankes felt; thinking of his
plants, & their nervous systems & respiratory organs:
In sciences,
there is creation; in art, creation; but in this
art, some say the
highest, there is nothing but abuse,
[strike]nothing but ?some high flown[/strike]
words, that mean nothing: intrigue;
(he will do well in Parliament
very likely, he thought) & when we ordinary people, who are
quite ready to do what we can to help, come & [strike]say tell us,[/strike]
tell us what to do, make us believe you;
[strike]we get[/strike] a handful of sand
thrown in our eyes.
Yet one must be scrupulously careful,
For Mr.
Tansley was
describing his ?own
success on a
tour.
Mr. Bankes corrected himself; [strike]for[/strike] It is undoubtedly to our
[strike]not[/strike]
interest [strike]to[/strike] that [strike]no[/strike] [strike]reformer should arise.[/strike]
[strike]things should remain as[/strike]
they are.
   Such thoughts [strike]were[/strike] could lead only in one direction: the
decay of religious belief.
And if at Mr. Ramsay's table
one began thinking of the
decay of religious belief, one looked,
naturally, at Mr. Ramsay.
   [strike]It is[/strike] "They are so much worse off" Mrs. Ramsay
[strike]?no[/strike] began, [strike]but[/strike] [strike]so much[/strike] under the influence of Mr.
Tansley's style that instead of thinking of Betty McNab
& Ellie Kennedy she thought of 'them', the poor,
who were [strike]w[/strike] 'happy' or miserable, in blocks;
but [strike]she could not stand[/strike] there were thing she could
not stand.
Certain hypocrisies, as they left her lips, stung her.
Here at last [strike]were[/strike] was the
309
He knew by some curious physical sensation, as of nerves erect, that
an  of some attack upon
he was jealous [strike]of[/strike] in [strike]some[/strike] obscure way; [strike]afra[/strike] anxious to
defend his own life work, his science; & therefore not entirely openminded
fair to this young man Tansley & his view; for Tansley seemed to
be saying [strike]to them all[/strike] How you have [strike]all[/strike] wasted your lives.
Tansley seemed to be rather a cocksure young man. But [strike]of course,[/strike]
Mr. Bankes allowed, he had courage on his side, & youth.
[strike]But[/strike]
It is,
[strike]However[/strike]
[strike]the immediate question was[/strike]
Mr. Bankes [strike]asked[/strike] observed to
that is
himself, [strike]what[/strike] the decay of religious
belief has been responsible
for much of this (that there is no St. Francis:
no [strike]gr[/strike] leader of social
reform) & if at Mr. Ramsays
table one began thinking of

the decay of religious belief, one looked, at least, at [strike]M.[/strike]
Mr. Ramsay.
   [strike]That the destruction[/strike] [strike]What indeed was he thinking?[/strike]
[strike]this[/strike] Not a combatant himself, Mr. Bankes had faith in
Ramsay, [strike]who[/strike] But at this moment, at this precise moment,
Mr. Ramsay's face expressed nothing but protest & even horror.
At what catastrophe? [strike]Poor[/strike] Mr. Carmichael had asked
for another plate of soup. Leaning back, he had
touched the maids arm,
& requested, that his plate should be
?din
returned to him, full.
And she had [strike]given him[/strike] his plate.
And he was now addressing
himself to his second helping
when one, according
to Mr. Ramsay, was
more than enough
for any human being;
when the process of drinking soup
was distressing:
when he slobbered it over his whiskers.
when of all things,
Mr. Ramsay detested hanging about
waiting
for people to finish.
This was in his face,
next
[strike]undisguised;[/strike]
& [strike]at any[/strike] moment [strike]he might say[/strike]
[strike]something:[/strike]
saying it
[?] eyes
though no
[strike]But[/strike] He was capable of it.
Like a pack of hounds his
words flew like smoke on
top of his emotions.
But -
Mrs. Ramsay had told him
[strike]of[/strike] that story about begging
eighteenpence to buy tobacco.
He should have his
soup in peace then:
he should gorge & guzzle to his hearts
content then; but nobody knew - so
311
[strike]Mr. Ramsay seemed to say, clasping his hands together, what anguish[/strike]
[strike]this restraint caused him; only his wife only his wife would[/strike]
[strike]give him credit for it.[/strike]
But if you clap the breaks onto a wheel
that is going full tilt - that ?was his sensation: for the
rapidity of his mind, & the acuteness of his sensations,
over trifles,
[strike]there[/strike] then sparks fly; & the whole of his body
was a shower of sparks; [strike]beautifully[/strike] perfectly, controlled, he
considered, looking at his wife to verify this statement,
[strike]He had not abused poor old[/strike]
[strike]Poor old Carmichael might[/strike]
[strike]have his soup,[/strike]
He remembered her story about
Carmichael begging eighteenpence to buy tobacco.
He
his soup for
wd.
[strike]could[/strike] not grudge him anything.
And [strike]sighing profoundly[/strike] Mr.
sharply
Ramsay enforced
his wifes demands that somebody
should
run up & pull
Andrew out of his bath; [strike]speaking[/strike] venting upon
his sons his tartness, his irritation, while consuming
soup
placidly, Mr. Carmichael sat [strike]in[/strike] there, unmoved,
benignant, to all appearances indifferent to this hubbub,
to that hubbub, wrapped in content.
   It might be true that he had asked his wife for
eighteen pence. [strike]She was certainly a most disagreeable lady.[/strike]
paid
a visit
It might be true that kind Mrs. Ramsay had [strike]visited[/strike] them
But
been up to
see them.
[strike]that sort of thing did not trouble him.[/strike] These sort of things made
little impression on him. [strike]He[/strike] In the vast & it must be
admitted bewildering hailstorm, among those variously
flying splinters of matter, things to do, thing not to do,
[strike]appointments to keep,[/strike] deciding this, deciding that, [strike]he had[/strike]

for the government of India is

cog to grip another cog impairs the efficiency
313
of the whole machine, so he would explain to his dear friend Andrew,
bearing nobody any malice, [strike]comp[/strike] never complaining of injustice,
& interested in his own case as in that of another;
among all these obstacles & impediments he had found only one
sure panacea to twiddle his ?long
thumbs before replying to a question
[strike]let yourself be driven to[/strike]
   [strike]Never speak in a hurry: he advised Andrew.[/strike]

And so with his acrostics;

He did not hurry himself. He liked the sound of words.
[strike]He believed that[/strike] He bade Andrew listen to the sound of words.
He translated Persian into English. [strike]What did[/strike] But here again he
[strike]waited[/strike] allowed the words to come
of their own accord. [strike]He had[/strike]
[strike]been told that people wrote things[/strike]

had twiddled his thumbs. So with his acrostics,

with this difference between them - Prue was

not restrain herself, seeing her father scowl, seeing Mr.

from [strike]such[/strike] a spasm of delight of merriment, of criticism (for

of amazement
at the astonishing

simultaneously exploded by the side board, & then, to make up,
lit the candles with the greatest assiduity; showing themselves
most eager, most indefatigable in this matter; so that
the eight white candles were soon lit, & their shades
stood upright
adjusted, & after the first stoop of the flames, they burnt [strike]up[/strike]
again & seemed to draw with them up into visibility
[strike]the whole of[/strike] the long table, & in particular [strike]Ros[/strike]

of the bunch that hangs over the shoulder of Bacchus, [strike]or is[/strike] among

It was odd, Mrs. Ramsay thought - her power [strike]of[/strike] with her hands; &
[strike]?Th[/strike] [strike]pr[/strike] in her pride, she saw how Mr. Carmichaels eyes
feasted like bees upon the sight, plunged themselves into it, &
broke this &

the night [strike]was outside;[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] separated off by panes of glass which
far from giving any accurate view of the hedge, or of the

in the midst of

on an island
if, safe & dry the company sat at table, surrounded by
[strike]wavering[/strike] waters sprinkled with lights.
[strike]It is[/strike]
   It has [strike]suddenly[/strike] become unreal, thought Lily Briscoe,
trying to account for the feeling of exhilaration which had
taken possession of them; & thinking how it was [strike]partly[/strike]
like the scene on the tennis lawn [strike]over[/strike] again, [strike]& was[/strike]
when they were all so light hearted, & was partly due to the
[strike]queer lighting[/strike] - [strike]these[/strike] little candles in the large, sparely

[strike]& Mrs. Ramsay, Minta Doyle,[/strike]
all of which had
to be set down, that is the dishes had
to be arranged;
Minta & Paul had to find their places (he between ?her ?&
Mrs. Ramsay; she beside Mr. Ramsay) & [strike]Minta[/strike]
they were both frightfully nervous.
   "Poor Minta lost her brooch" said
Mrs. Ramsay instantly.
9
   "Yes, my grandmother's brooch" said Minta, [strike]to[/strike] with a sound
of lament in her voice; & a suffusion of her large brown eyes which
[strike]in[/strike] roused all the chivalry in
Mr. Ramsays heart; so that he
he scolded her [strike]for being[/strike] [strike]dryly.[/strike]
   How could she be such a fool? he [strike]said[/strike] asked.
She was by way of being terrified of Mr. Ramsay
& he was moved by
the [strike]odd[/strike] lampit
love she had, her
glow, her
untidiness,

She was by way of being terrified of [strike]Mr. Ramsay.[/strike] He was so fearfully
clever. [strike]In truth, she got on with him beautifully, &[/strike] He made her
feel so common, she would say; [strike]& she had tried to talk about[/strike]
&
it terrified her to
be made to talk
to him,
especially as
[strike]George Eliot, whom he mentioned, but nervous of[/strike] having left

[strike]frightened, only enough to make it seem rather daring to[/strike]

[strike]she felt[/strike] what Lily Briscoe had never felt in the course of her life -
& thought she
felt
that [strike]every[/strike] round about her was a golden haze. She could not help it:
she could not alter it. Sometime she had it; sometimes not; [strike]or[/strike] but
knew that
to night she had it; she [strike]was awfully glad to think that[/strike] tonight
somehow so that
he spoke with that
the
curious tone ?wh

Please, what had he

been doing? [strike]What right had he to[/strike] [strike]Had he been virtuously[/strike]
[strike]occupied?[/strike] (for she could chatter to him any nonsense) [strike]Reading?[/strike]
How many pipes had he smoked?
It was a fact that
about
George Eliot,
Mr. Ramsay liked talking nonsense [strike]better than anything in the world[/strike]
+
for a time, with a young woman,
with a pretty young
not
quite
better than
woman, who, (but the distinction he made was [strike]not[/strike] [strike]by no means[/strike]
clear) [strike]looked[/strike] [strike]did her hair,[/strike] "didn't scrape her hair [strike]up[/strike]"; which
off
anything in the
world
Minta did not, but Lily Briscoe did; & that included
some thing flying, something even a little wild &
?into
bold & harumscarum
into the bargain.
There was some
quality, which Mrs. Ramsay
herself had not - some lustre, some
richness, some intemperance, which
attracted him: solaced
him; & led him to devise curious treats for these
15
13
favourites; they might cut his hair for him; plait him chains, or
interrupt his work, pulling him [strike]up[/strike] out of his chair to play at
croquet with them;
   Mrs. Ramsay knew it. At this very moment she felt it, &
asked herself how then it would have been if he had married one of
them - those girls she meant, with a certain golden-reddishness
about them, like Minta, whom she liked
too;
indeed she was
indeed
she was
not jealous; almost grateful to them,
for their
[strike]pulling[/strike] laughing at
him, till he seemed young & fiery & romantic;
[strike]no longer[/strike] &
not caustic; not [strike]w[/strike] burdened; not overcome
with the greatness of his
labours & the sorrows of the world & the [strike]failure, or[/strike]
precise degree of failure or success of his books;
but again, as she
had known him, at the beginning of life,
[strike]with his temper[/strike]
simple
gallant[strike]ry[/strike] & [strike]his simplicity[/strike]
For herself, she liked [strike]the[/strike]
her boobies - that was her
husband's name for young men
like Paul Rayley [strike]who were not brilliant;[/strike] [strike]but never[/strike]
[strike]pretended to be anything[/strike]
There was, she thought, beckoning
Paul to a seat beside her, something most charming about a
young man of twentysix,
[strike]& so who is not all nerves, & all[/strike]
He need not be brilliant.
[strike]She was not brilliant[/strike] She had
enough of brilliance.
And how unfair, & how absurd, & how
[strike]entirely lacking in commonsense examiners are, she[/strike]
sorry awfully sorry
whatever there was.
And he gave [strike]her a[/strike] [strike]flower[/strike]?
[strike]It was something common that grows on moors;[/strike]

[strike]what had happened was that he[/strike]

take it & keep it; [strike]& put it away among those[/strike] so it

   ?For [strike]what could one say?[/strike]
They had agreed
[strike]Yet[/strike] [strike]But he did[/strike] And yet when he saw
her, he felt he must

her a flower he had
in his button hole.
Which he had meant to keep always.

sat
[strike]how sorry[/strike] beside her, saying that he was sorry, awfully sorry, that they were late,
did not deserve any food, & so on.
But it was
   [strike]No sooner had he sat down than[/strike] [strike]it seemed[/strike] impossible [strike]that[/strike]

that she should not [strike]know[/strike] knew [strike]what had happened to him;[/strike] how, since lunch,
[strike]such a thing had[/strike] [strike]happened;[/strike] [strike]he[/strike] a thing had happened; [strike]which[/strike]
& it
he was changed; [strike]all[/strike]
was her doing; [strike]yet[/strike] [strike]"We[/strike]

   We [strike]had to ?look go[/strike] went back to look for Minta's

his tremor over
by [strike]the way[/strike]
[strike]for[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay [strike]to[/strike] knew then;
"we" [strike]went back;[/strike] & then
it cost him to say
the little effort the [strike]little hesitation[/strike] in saying Minta; she
[strike]knew then for certain, & having[/strike] & by [strike]the[/strike] especially by that
'we' which, she thought [strike]will[/strike] is the first time I have heard him
say it, & it seemed to her extremely moving on his lips "we",
that they were now
when it implied, as she knew it did, [strike]a[/strike] a lifetime
together, for life,
&
&
[strike]?implied[/strike] his care, his suffering -
She knew then [strike][?][/strike] [strike]exactly[/strike] what

had happened, & how he could [strike]scarcely[/strike]
[strike]keep his eyes off[/strike]
[u]Minta[/u], [strike]or[/strike] & how the [strike]table[/strike] lights glittered
in his eyes; & how
how
everybody seemed to him a little unreal; &
[strike]an immense[/strike]
gratitude filled his heart.
[strike]But she must help them[/strike]
   [strike]But from the[/strike]
A [strike]fragrance rose from the great[/strike]
peering into the ?great

   "It is a triumph" said William Bankes - It was delicious: it was

rich; it was tender; it was
[strike]thoughtful[/strike] cooking with skill & taste in it, not

lumps of meat up [strike]roast[/strike] browned over.
How did she manage these things in the depths of the country?
he asked her?
She was a wonderful woman - he thought

It [strike]was[/strike] a French [strike]dish[/strike]", said Mrs. Ramsay. [strike]She was[/strike]
agreed
She [strike]felt[/strike] with Mr. Bankes, [strike]that[/strike] what passes for cookery in
England is [strike]simply[/strike] an abomination. It is putting
cabbage in water. [strike]It is[/strike] [strike]Then you throw away the water which[/strike]
[strike]It is[/strike] Stews, [strike]rice puddings[/strike] - "which can be [strike]d[/strike] so delicious in France -

roasting, [strike]never anything else:[/strike]
& [strike]so wasteful[/strike] that a French family
can
[strike]could[/strike] [strike]easily[/strike] live, on what an English cook throws away.
Upon all this they were [strike]entirely[/strike] agreed: so strangely
19
They [strike]agreed. How happy she seemed, for[/strike] [strike]bein[/strike] [strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike] Her
exaggerations gave her a sense of extraordinary [strike]happiness.[/strike] happiness.
She was spurred on by some inner exhilaration: [strike]one[/strike]
English
said
   "Any little French Inn," she [strike]was saying[/strike] -
& Lily laughed at her. How childlike, how absurd - yes, Mrs. Ramsay was
overpowering. [strike]Sh[/strike] always she got her own way [strike]Its[/strike] Lily
thought that she had brought off this now - Paul & Minta were engaged -
& she was perfectly
happy.
[strike]& it seemed her doing.[/strike]
She put a spell on people. Why Lily
   [strike]"How did Minta[/strike] felt it - [strike]the[/strike] She felt Paul
Rayley sitting there [strike]silent;[/strike] under that spell; [strike]that[/strike] for it was
Mrs. Ramsay's doing that too - [strike]there[/strike] that deep, that inarticulate,
?glowing
that [strike]glowing[/strike] terrifying [strike]attractive[/strike] [strike]male[/strike] silence - [strike]Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
[strike]exalted that; worshipped that; & acknowledged that as the[/strike]
[strike]light of life, its[/strike] & the way he kept looking across at Minta,
&
his tremor, his abstraction - Mrs. Ramsay sanctioned all
that, worshipped that, & would [strike]in her[/strike] having achieved
somehow laugh
that
[strike]proceed[/strike] to
lead her victims,
[strike]garlanded,[/strike] to the altar.
[strike]But Lily did feel it, herself:[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]she felt it really too much. She[/strike]
[strike]felt inconspicuous, insignificant,[/strike]
[strike]sitting beside Paul Rayley; &[/strike]
[strike]like a[/strike]
And she felt it herself.
She [strike]felt[/strike] [strike]more[/strike] emotionally
how inconspicuous she was by his side; he, glowing, burning;
she aloof, satirical; he bound for adventure; she moored to the
banks; he, in some way launched, incautious, given; & she
solitary & unillusioned; left out, [strike]unclaimed[/strike] - she was
ready to implore a share [strike]in his[/strike]

in his disaster & said
   "How did Minta lose her brooch?"
She was repaid by the most exquisite smile; veiled

   Lily would have liked to [strike]have taken[/strike] vowed violently  believing
outrageously [strike]her[/strike] that she would
help him; [strike]only[/strike] hoping that
she would be the one, in the early dawn,
to light upon the brooch,
on the beach, & then be included among the
sailors &
adventurers, [strike]the[/strike] those who have
sacrificed, cast adrift, & [strike]gone[/strike]

   But what did he reply to her offer? She actually said
come [?with]
with an emotion she seldom let appear,
[strike]Do[/strike] [strike]I[/strike] [strike]L[/strike]et me help you

He laughed. [strike]Perhaps[/strike] he meant
yes or no - Either perhaps.
But
it was an odd chuckle. [strike]So[/strike] entirely regardless of her:
[strike]so[/strike] as if
he had said Throw yourself over the cliff if you like; [strike]as if[/strike]
[strike]he had said - Lily found herself veering violently away[/strike]
[strike][strike]again in the opposite direction[/strike][/strike]
turned the heat of love
upon her cheek, & scorched her, where she had seen only the
lovely
[strike]brilliant[/strike] flame: the
heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its
savagery
treachery, its
unscrupulosity.
Lily looked at Minta,
at the other end of the table;
being charming; [strike]be[/strike] in the centre of her [strike]golden haze,[/strike] &
[strike]could see her,[/strike] [strike]shrank for her,[/strike] trembled for her, exposed to the
heat of love;

What [strike]quite[/strike] like a deer gashed, or a

then, seeing the [strike]m[/strike] salt cellar, she remembered with a start,

she

marry anybody even

[strike]She had her painting. And the[/strike]
[strike]detestable passion,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]which the unscrupulous, the demented, the[/strike]

but might paint. might escape
the [strike]horror[/strike] of brutality
which this estimable passion
lets loose upon the world,

Such was the complexity of things.
For what happened [strike]at the Ramsays[/strike] was
[strike]simply[/strike] Lily, [strike]especially[/strike] at
the Ramsays was to think
[strike]what she[/strike]
[strike]could not say,[/strike] [strike]Indeed[/strike]
it
two things at a time, one the opposite of the other,
as now; love is [strike]the[/strike]
beautiful, [strike]but [/strike]so
that I tremble on the verge of it
[strike]throwing myself into the flame;[/strike] but [strike]also despicable;[/strike]
it is also the lowest &
vilest of passions, so that a nice

young man, with a perfect [strike]profile[/strike]

how from the dawn of history odes have been sung to Love,

she supposed; & luckily there was no compulsion upon her to
always
tell it.
[strike]All her life[/strike] she would say [strike]one thing &[/strike]
what other
it was
people said.
It was safer, simpler,
& so frightfully difficult to
For
be quite sure what one meant.
[strike]For it was[/strike]
[strike]Yes,[/strike] she did
feel moved by Paul, Minta; she [strike]could not deny it.[/strike] [strike]liked them[/strike]

   [strike]Mr.[/strike] [strike]"There is,[/strike] said Mr. Bankes, That liquid the English
said Mr. Bankes
call coffee", - a remark that roused Mrs. Ramsay to
the depths of her heart, & [strike]was[/strike] [strike]broug[/strike] led directly to
the allied but more [strike]agust[/strike] august questions of pure butter &
uncontaminated milk; [strike]as her sons & daughters were aware,[/strike]
[strike]for[/strike] [strike]s[/strike]Speaking with emphasis & eloquence, [strike]as if she had[/strike]
[strike]never mentioned the subject before,[/strike]
she described the iniquity
of the English dairy, was about to
substantiate her [strike]argument[/strike]
when
[strike]with[/strike] charges [strike]when[/strike]
[strike]yells & peals, the[/strike] all round
the table, beginning with Andrew,
in the middle, like a fire
[?]
25
which leaping from tuft to tuft of furze, her children laughed; her husband
laughed; she was laughed at, fire-encircled, & forced to [strike]va[/strike] vail her
crest, dismount her batteries & only retaliate by displaying the raillery
[strike]am[/strike] ridicule of the table to Mr. Bankes as [strike]the[/strike] an example of
what one suffered attacking the prejudices of the British
public.
she
Conveniently, for she had it on her mind that Lily
was out of things,
exempted her[strike], &[/strike] from the rest; claimed her an adherent; &
so drew her in[strike],[/strike]. [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]charming old maid, as Mr. Ramsay called[/strike]
[strike]c[/strike]Charming as she was, & exquisite in her own way too, with her
[strike]sa[/strike] little puckered up face & Chinese eyes,] She was out of things, Mrs.
Ramsay felt; so was Charles Tansley; both suffered from
comparison with the glow of the other [strike]two[/strike]. Both were aware of it,
she felt; [strike]while it made[/strike] Charles Tansley [strike]disagreeable, - quite[/strike]
[strike]naturally, it depressed her poor little Brisk, she[/strike] was all on
poor fellow
pins & needles.
No woman would look at him with Paul Rayley
in the room.
[strike]there.[/strike]
With Lily it was
different.
She faded; became more [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]more[/strike] inconspicuous than ever.
Yet, thought Mrs. Ramsay as
charming as she was
with her
little puckered
face & Chinese
eyes.
she claimed her help, [strike]in[/strike] (for Lily should bear her out that
she had not talked
about
butter & milk for at least three days;)
[strike]she is[/strike] of the two
Lily will wear better.
For there was in
a little flare of
Lily a [strike]sort of[/strike] thread of something; an angularity. [strike]a ch[/strike]
a [strike]quality[/strike] of character which in [strike]her[/strike] spite of everything Mrs.
Ramsay [strike]could not[/strike] liked, respected; though no man would.
Obviously not.
Unless it were an [strike]od[/strike] older man, like
William Bankes.
But then he cared, well, Mrs.
Ramsay thought sometimes
that he cared, now that his wife was
dead, more than any one for her.
27
Oh but nonsense, she thought. William shall marry Lily.
   Foolishly, she had set them opposite to each other. That could be remedied tomorrow.
Everything seemed possible. Everything seemed right. [strike]It seemed so[/strike]
Just now, (this cannot last, she thought) she hovered, like a hawk,
suspended; like a flag [strike]flutt[/strike] floating, in the element of
joy which filled every nerve in her body [strike]&[/strike] [strike]without[/strike]
fully & sweetly, [strike]&[/strike] not noisily, [strike]& th[/strike] [?] rather solemnly; for
did it not arise, partly, from [strike]the[/strike] solemn things? love of
husband, love of children, love of friends[strike],[/strike] ?
[strike]& not[/strike]
which
in this profound stillness (she was [strike]h[/strike] helping William Bankes to one
very small piece more[strike])[/strike] & peered into the depths of the ea
earthenware pot)
seemed, [strike]with[/strike] for no special reason, [strike]without a[/strike]
word said, or any [strike][/strike][strike][?] accident to bring it about,[/strike] in the ordinary
suddenly -
wonderfully
course of things to rise up, & [strike]become - Could one imagine such a[/strike]
[strike]thing - like a peal of silent bells; or the[/strike] like a smoke, an incense, or
a fume which being [strike]invisible &[/strike] imperceptible to the ordinary
senses [strike]one might[/strike] was for her with her dreading [strike]of ins[/strike] expression as [strike]shaded[/strike]
[strike]insincerity & words[/strike] [strike]sentimentality[/strike] & [strike]words are always one or[/strike]
[strike]the other[/strike] The insincerity, the sentimentality of words [strike]was for her[/strike]
divinely satisfactory; & partook, she felt, carefully helping Mr.
Bankes, of eternity, [strike]reminding her[/strike] was immune, like the past itself,
so solid &
entire it seemed
from change & glowed in the face of [strike][?][/strike] ruin [strike]&[/strike] a constant
jewel, so that here tonight was the heaven for such as her;
   Yes, she assured him, there was quite enough.
Andrew wanted more. -

lies [strike][?][/strike] close about the moon; [strike]the[/strike]
   [strike]And[/strike] [strike]moving[/strike] there [strike]with the since[/strike] She could move
or be at rest; could wait a moment, now that they were
all helped; & then like the hawk which lapses suddenly
from its high [strike]station[/strike] poise, flaunt & sink, on laughter,
easily, reposing her whole weight upon what at the other
29
end of the table her husband was saying about - was it square
roots, cubes, the numbers on tickets? [strike]And[/strike]
   Mrs. Ramsay did not know to this day what [strike]that[/strike] it meant:
but her husband did. Her sons did [strike]too[/strike]. She leant on their strength
Cubes & square roots & [strike]y[/strike] [strike]x[/strike] x plus y;

Voltaire, Madame de Stael & the

she let it
[strike]all[/strike] uphold her, & sustain her,
this admirable fabric of
[strike]beautiful[/strike] masculine intelligence
which ran up & down,


like iron girders [strike]which, without[/strike]
crossed this way & that, upheld the world:
[strike]Until[/strike] so that she
could trust herself to it utterly, &
even shut her eyes,
or blink them
&
dreaming
be lost for a moment, like a child [strike]blinking[/strike] up from its
pillows at myriad ?layers of the leaves of a tree; & then, waking,
[strike]she would[/strike] there it was [strike]be[/strike] [strike]in[/strike] still being fabricated.
For
now
William Bankes was [strike]giving his opinion of the[/strike] [strike]pre[/strike] ?prasing;
Waverley novels; & springing to his feet, metaphorically,
rejoicing at this chance of assering his existence, Charles Tansley
whose father was a chemist, whose grandfather was a
[strike]in his ?own[/strike]
[strike]boat[/strike] [strike]fisherman, was denouncing with how if they asked him,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]had C English literature[/strike]
was denouncing them.
Being [strike]a[/strike] the son of a working man [strike]he was of course[/strike] [strike]he was[/strike]
he [strike]approached literature from a different point of view.[/strike]
he said
Literature is not a mere pastime for idle hours.
So many
people at the table had enjoyed some books occasionally that
they felt  uncomfortable.
If only Prue would be decently kind
to him, Mrs. Ramsay thought, he would not say these things.
[strike]But[/strike] for though William Bankes would never be [strike]rude,[/strike]
unkind, she could [strike]judge[/strike] what he was thinking - impertinent
puppy,
like that &

& all the rest of it. And he was not,

   William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.
Then
snatched his chance
Charles Tansley, like a dog [strike]let off the chain at last,[/strike]
[strike]denounced[/strike]
[strike]them[/strike] As the son of a chemist, the grandson of a fisherman, he
rushed in - all
because Prue would not be nice to him; &
denounced them;
when [strike]anybody[/strike] [strike]it was all[/strike] when he knew
nothing about it,
nothing whatever, Mrs. Ramsay thought,
[strike]like[/strike] [strike]All[/strike]
[strike]The world was so divided, she thought;[/strike] observing, rather
than listening, for it
was the way people said things, not the
actual things they said,
which convinced her. conveyed to her the
[strike]aptitude or[/strike] their aptitude
or disaptitude & you had only to
to [strike]see[/strike] tell

down the law
[strike]about the[/strike] [strike]to know how it was[/strike]
[strike]hopeless forever,[/strike]
[strike]how he knew nothing, nothing whatever, but[/strike]
[strike]then, ni[/strike]
that [strike]he did not know, had[/strike]
how he was among
those [strike]whose[/strike] the natural enemies
of all [strike]painting &[/strike] arts
[strike]writing,[/strike] for which she bore him no grudge.
No. For
then they were free to do other things; [strike]&, if it was unfortunate[/strike]
[strike]that it[/strike] young men of his type were [strike]necessary;[/strike] & [strike][?][/strike] if it was
unfortunate [strike]that[/strike] & [strike]did[/strike] hindered the progress of the world
that they had these limitations [strike]yet it was enviable, too, & left[/strike]
[strike]so that she had never known[/strike] it freed them; & lent him that
fierceness, that power, [strike]which[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] [strike]which issuing as it did[/strike]
which might issue in a love [strike]of ?his[/strike] mankind, qualified as that
seemed to be inevitably by his hatred of the arts - And
that
somebody, not Prue, would be kind to him, & then she felt,
[strike]again[/strike] he will not say [strike]all day long "my[/strike]
one moment
will be
"my dissertation;" the next, "my grandfather" - but [strike]would,[/strike]
[strike]well, he would[/strike] never be in the least like Mr. Carmichael -
For he was chanting somebodies poem, why she did not know
33
& in her [strike]clairvoyant[/strike] state she saw him denouncing the Waverly
novels because his feelings were snubbed, & thus he must protest,
how
he
was the
son of a workingman, [[strike]?][/strike] &
& she could see how it was - he wanted to assert himself, & so
it would always be with him until he had [strike]was[/strike] [strike]his[/strike] got his
professorship, or married his wife, [strike]& then he [strike]would be[/strike][/strike]
[strike]very valuable in some way. she had free to do what[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]but at present he could only say at one moment[/strike]
[strike]"my dissertation"[/strike]
[strike]but[/strike] & it was [strike]sheer non[/strike] [strike]moonshine all this about[/strike]
when he was
thinking of himself
nonsense for him to [strike]pretend that he[/strike] to talk about books;
as she could tell by the sound of his voice, & his emphasis, & his
uneasiness. [strike]But he[/strike] [strike]But inevitably the[/strike] [strike]But[/strike] [strike]&[/strike] In her
clearsightedness which seemed [strike]to pierce the[/strike] [strike]without effort[/strike] or
[strike]bitterness to unveil one after another,[/strike] to go round the table
unveiling each of them without effort, [strike]in a tranquil[/strike] like a
light stealing under the water so that its ripples, & the reeds in it,
& the
impression
he was
making,
& the minnows balancing themselves & the sudden silent
trout are all held up in their reality to the [strike]view[/strike] eye to [strike]feast on[/strike]
look upon: [strike]then glancing[/strike] she saw & heard them
[strike]& liked her husband for his annoyance: about the Waverly novels; yet[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]for he was being saddened suddenly & sincerely by this little[/strike]
[strike]man's dislike of the Waverly novels - which he knew by heart;[/strike]
[strike][strike]then she like[/strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]for what & then there was Mr. Bankes[/strike]
[strike]liked Jane Austen, &[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]& their but whatever they said[/strike]
[strike](for instance[/strike] Mr.
had this quality [strike]that it[/strike] as if [strike]when she saw[/strike]
& ?friends
what they said was [strike]only[/strike] like the movement of the trout, when
[strike]the same time the ripple moves, the light[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]changes quivers; & the[/strike]
[strike]all is suspended in the same[/strike]
one can see
the ripple & the
[strike]light, & the[/strike] whole life in the stream & the gravel, &
something
solemn & dark surrounding that one flash; so that [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]she now[/strike]
if
Mr. Bankes
said how much he preferred
35
Jane Austen to any other writer
so that it passed out of Mrs. Ramsay's mind [strike]that she ?did had any[/strike]
[strike]reason for[/strike] how, naturally, in daily life, she would be
casting a net over
all this, [strike]&[/strike] & forced by the
exigencies of behaviour to
separate & judge &
connect & applaud -
Now it was
37
[strike]But n[/strike]Now she dwelt on it; with her wings spread;
   It was [strike]really interesting.[/strike] How long do books last?
[strike]Then,[/strike] what qualities make them last? [strike]Then, Mr. Ramsay[/strike]
its being ?said
She minded the fact that Scott was out of date. Mr. Bankes
laughed & attached no importance to these changes in fashion. [strike]who[/strike]
Who could tell what was [strike]go[/strike] going to last? who minded?
Mr. Ramsay minded very much. He thought constantly of
his own fame;
Mr. Bankes scarcely ever thought of such
things at all.
Mr. Tansley was reading Tolstoy. [About
that he was quite enthusiastic.
Mrs. Ramsay thought
that he had given up thinking
about himself.
He
novel
thought War & Peace
the
greatest [strike]book[/strike] in the [strike]w[/strike] world. Still he
was thinking of himself a
little. He was never as
impersonal as Mr. Bankes.
What is taste? asked
Mr. Bankes.
Nothing made him budge from his own
view -
he did not mind leaving books unread. He read Jane
Austen &
Scott over & over again. [strike]M[/strike] Paul Rayley
But
liked
Trollope
He could think of nothing clever to say.
[strike]however[/strike]
[strike]so he[/strike] Minta said [strike]her grea[/strike] she did not
really
believe that anybody
liked [strike]reading[/strike] Shakespeare.
[strike]At this[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay
[strike]liked this very much indeed.[/strike]
[strike]And[/strike] ?[strike]he[/strike] agreed that
very few people liked it as
much as they said they did.
[strike]Andrew thought that[/strike]
[strike]this was going too far.[/strike]
[strike]But some of it is[/strike]
[strike]People might not see that his father was ironical.[/strike]
but he
added
There is considerable merit in some of it, however,
he said.
Minta supposed he was was making
fun of her.
But she did not mind in the least.
He was so vain, so extraordinarily vain, that
one need never be frightened of him - perhaps not so
much frightened of him as of Mrs. Ramsay, who was not
39
not vain, so that you could scarcely take her off her guard.
Mrs. Ramsay thought [strike]almost[/strike] almost the same thing of Paul
Rayley - how much nicer, she found stupidity than cleverness.
& perhaps more
inscrutable
For the stupid have no ambition to thrust themselves forwards,
& thus instead of always thinking am I being clever, am I
being admired they think whether one is hot or cold, whether
one [strike]mu[/strike] feels the draught, or would like [strike]another[/strike] a pear;
She might sit there
forever, & Charles Tansley would never
remember to offer her a pear.
But then Paul
Rayley
[strike]And[/strike] would; & so, [strike]again[/strike] [strike]spr[/strike]
fluttering her
wings over the table & all these odds & ends of speech,
which were like the [strike]little[/strike] darts & dashes of trout, she
felt no
[strike]grudge against Charles Tansley,[/strike] [strike]any more than[/strike]
[strike]against that fish, for[/strike] [strike]how there is no[/strike] [strike]The reeds[/strike] saw
at the same time the reeds in the pool, & the
walls of brown water [strike]& the night,[/strike] [strike]when[/strike]
Nancy
surrounding them; [strike]when,[/strike] [strike]having looked at the[/strike]
deciding that after all she did not want a pear,
she
suddenly saw Rose's creation, rising up like a
crown or bouquet of flowers on the top of the water;
with its beautiful curves, & its interstices, its hollows &
huge bulges; [strike]something[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]extraordinarily[/strike]
& her
eyes
[strike]beautiful[/strike] [strike]it was[/strike] [strike]she pl[/strike] she too, like Mr.
Carmichael, went plundering the fruit, [strike]n[/strike]
[strike]trying[/strike] first looking at the banana, then at the pears,
& putting one colour against another, one curve, one
hollow, without knowing why she did it, but
[strike]gett[/strike] each time she [strike]saw[/strike] did it she [strike]was[/strike]
became gradually more satisfied, & [strike]more[/strike] [strike]until rising[/strike] she
[strike]saw to[/strike] & she [strike]called[/strike] looked at Rose & Timothy &
Prue & Andrew all sitting side by side, & thought
41
Mrs. Ramsay knew all that, & hoped that the talk would soon leave
But then
this dangerous subject of [strike]book[/strike] the fame of books.
Minta said
she did not believe that anyone really enjoyed reading
Shakespeare. &
   But he added, there is considerable merit in some of the plays.
saw
& Mrs. Ramsay [strike]wondered whether[/strike] [strike]?th[/strike] [strike]seeing[/strike] that Minta
liked being laughed
at & was not frightened; [strike]that[/strike] she
realised his extreme vanity, & would take care of him,
so that she attended now to [strike]Paul Rayley[/strike] who [strike]wished to[/strike]
anxiety about his
own books & his
own fame,
[strike]to show that he had read books[/strike] to what Paul Rayley was
trying to say: how he thought Trollope was better in his way
than Dickens. A very stupid remark. Mrs. Ramsay
knew that, but then how much nicer stupidity is, she
thought [strike]when[/strike] than cleverness, for when Charles Tansley
said that War & Peace knocked out all the Waverly novels &
all Jane Austen, what he meant was Tolstoy would have
approved [strike]as[/strike] of me, but not of you (that is, not of
people who have servants & table napkins) - & [strike]that was[/strike]
[strike]really stupider,[/strike] [strike]more stupid;[/strike] he was thinking of himself,
but Paul, like all stupid people, never thought am I
being clever, am I being admired, never thought about
himself at all, but whether she was hot or cold,
whether she felt the draught, whether she wanted a
pear.
[strike]And though she[/strike] She did not want a pear; [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]wanted him to go on, ?being[/strike] [strike]wanted nothing;[/strike] [strike]Her[/strike]
[strike]eyes rested on the dish of fruit[/strike] She did not want
anybody to take any fruit. Her eyes rested on the
dish & went in & out of the [strike]round[/strike] apples & the
thick [strike]bananas into[/strike] the interstices & hollows, among
the grapes & bananas, putting a yellow against a
purple, & then a curved [strike]ag[/strike] shape against a round shape,
&
43
without knowing why she did it, or why [strike]she[/strike] [strike]beca[/strike] as she did it she
became happier, & then she thought, looking at Rose, who
[strike]set[/strike] sat between Timothy & Prue, how [strike]t[/strike] odd[strike], she[/strike]
that one's child should do that!
her children
to see them sitting there,
   How odd that they should sit there in a row, Timothy
Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke
of their own going on, she [strike]kn[/strike] knew, from the twitching of
their lips.
[strike]What it could be, she[/strike] It was something [strike][?][/strike]
quite apart from [strike]what[/strike] everything else,
something
that would not end when
they were hoarding up: something
that would
that would [strike]serve[/strike] to carry the world
on when her own
all that
ripple was spent.
[strike]Hoarded behind[/strike] There [strike]was[/strike] hoarded
the door
was shut
upon their
own room -
she wondered
what.
As if the joke
wd explode
when they were
all dead in the
future -
behind those rather set, rather solemn faces; for they did
not yet talk easily, [strike]though Prue[/strike] [strike]But[/strike] Prue certainly was
tonight

lovely, lovelier than she had ever looked, as if the
glow of Minta opposite, the [strike]sense of[/strike] happiness, the
excitement of the evening, were reflected in her; [strike]but[/strike] it was
the [strike][?][/strike] rising of that marvellous
sun, [strike]?man[/strike] the love of
men & women, which, [strike]as it[/strike]
was stealing over the
rim of the tablecloth, & [strike]wit[/strike] entirely
without her
[strike]restin[/strike] in her eyes & making
knowing it, was [strike]giving her that sky that[/strike]
making her
curiously
glance at Minta now & then, shyly,
[strike]happily[/strike], so that
Mrs. Ramsay, hovering over one &
then over another
vowed to ?herself But
as they said this & that,
[strike]you shall ?have,[/strike] [strike]all that,[/strike]
[strike]much[/strike] more [strike]than all that[/strike] [strike](for she was her own[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]daughter)[/strike]
[strike]one of these days.[/strike]
But you will be
far happier one of these days, because you are
my daughter, she meant, & therefore it was certain
that she would be happier, as they were all, to Mrs.
45
&
protected in some odd way, [strike]made[/strike]
raised above the lot of
ordinary people - a fact which was due to her husband, not herself,
that [strike]great man,[/strike] [strike]but he[/strike] & [strike]rising[/strike] she [strike]said rose &[/strike]
& hesitating for a moment she looked to see if they were ready
to leave the dinner table: but he was having some joke with
Minta; [strike]a bet about some ?game, thing;[/strike] about a bet,
how proper
[?] in
she waited;
[strike]of course[/strike] Paul Rayley was thinking how
marvellous Minta was
&
William Bankes [strike]had really[/strike] wa
enjoyed himself she knew; & Charles Tansley - she
&
liked him better for being so annoyed.
Lily seemed to
how aloof she
was! how
independent
of them all!
[strike]have some private joke of her own - she lik that was[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]Lily's point; &[/strike]
[strike]she always had some little affair of her own[/strike]
moment
she felt
[strike]on hand -[/strike]
[strike]She waited.[/strike]
This partook of eternity; was
[strike]imm[/strike] immune from change!
[strike]A[/strike] This glowed in the face of
chaos; [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]She looked at the window. But the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]but it was now so dark that only the candles were[/strike]
[strike]to be seen in it;[/strike]
[strike]dark now, with candles wavering in it.[/strike]
[strike]They were like[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]Here were the walls of the stream[/strike]
which surrounded
[strike]them, & then[/strike] as [strike]they were by the walls[/strike]
& it seemed to her as if she [strike]were still floating[/strike]
could go in & out here, [strike]among the dishes[/strike] & the glasses,
glowed
even as the window with its little candlelights (for
as
the pane was now dark [strike]with[/strike] night[strike])[/strike] & the flames
burnt brighter) [strike]glowed[/strike] &
also it was like a
a poem a
great cathedral
with the sudden bursts of laughter, &
then one voice [strike]spea[/strike]
(Minta's) speaking alone; &
[strike]it[/strike] like some service
in a Roman Catholic Church;
which always [strike]seemed to[/strike] her irreverent & therefore
she waited;
her husband was in such spirits that
he was [strike]quoting[/strike] laughing at Carmichael;
old Mr. Carmichael rousing himself was quoting the
words
But it would never come ?h
47
& a voice (Mr. Carmichael's) began chanting
[ind/]Come out & climb the garden path
[ind/]Luriana Lurilee
[ind/]The China rose is all abloom & buzzing with
[ind/][ind/]the yellow bee
& the words sounded
[strike]but she[/strike] [strike]which[/strike] sounded as if [strike]it[/strike]
they
were floating about in
came from the darkness outside
& had no connection with any body
[ind/]I wonder if it seems to you
[ind/][ind/]Luriana Lurilee
[ind/]That all the lives we ever lived &
[ind/][ind/]all the lives to be

Nor did she [strike]attach[/strike] [strike]much meaning to them[/strike]
know quite what they meant, but like music[strike],[/strike] they
[strike]relieved her of the[/strike] seemed to [strike]make[/strike] to
saying what [strike]everybody had been feeling, &[/strike]
she had felt, everybody had felt, but by herself she could never known

when she went,
how they missed it.
that firm swift [strike]secret[/strike] [strike]secret[/strike] decided way, Not that she [strike]was[/strike] in fact
did
run or hurry upstairs;
She felt, rather, inclined just for a
moment, [strike]to shed, as it[/strike] to stand still, after all that
one
chattering, & pick out [strike]whatever it was[/strike] some single thing:
the fact that Paul & Minta were engaged; to detach it,
separate it off; clean it of all the emotions & follies; & so
hold it before her; bring it to the tribunal where, ranged
about in conclave sat the judges she had set up in her to
decide these things. Is it good, bad, right wrong? Am I
justified? Where does this all tend? & so on, righting
herself after the shock of the event; & quite incongruously,
using the branches of the elm trees outside [strike]as[/strike]
to stabilise her position. ?All must be in order.
She must get that right, & that right, she thought, [strike]?as ?if[/strike]
insensibly approving of the dignity, ?of the tranquility, &
now again of the very ?beautily upward fling of the
elm branches, as the [strike]wind r[/strike] wind raised them.

[strike]clear[/strike]
It was windy, so that the
leaves now & then brushed [strike]open[/strike] a star,
[strike]& lit it[/strike] & the stars
themselves seemed to be shaking &
darting light & trying to flash out [strike]irregular[/strike] between the
with
edges of the leaves.
Yes, that was done then; & as [strike]over[/strike] all
[strike]people[/strike]
things done, now one thought of it, clear of chatter &
[strike]emotion[/strike],
it
[strike]one flicked it[/strike]
it seemed that it had always been, & was
now shown, &
[strike]had been thought of in the dawn of things,[/strike]

They
would come back to this night then.
And it
pleased her to think how [strike]in the[/strike] all their lives long [strike]with[/strike]
in
their memories she would be woven, & this, & this, & this,
& she went ?in, noticing
with a laughing affection, for
she knew their shabbiness

& the [strike]cha[/strike] rocking chair & the
bust of her mother.

so she thought, with her hand
on the nursery door,
feeling that community with other people which emotion
had
gives as if suddenly the walls
of partition became thin
[strike]as[/strike]
[strike]paper,[/strike] so that her own
death
would matter rather less,
[?] [?] [?]
since Paul & Minta [strike]inherited[/strike]
the things she had
so that
practically it
was all one
stream &
accumulated - the table, the rocking chair, &
map, &
[strike]taking them in to the stream of their own lives,[/strike]
would sweep them on [strike]& on & on[/strike]
[strike]And[/strike] she [strike]open[/strike]
turned the door handle, [strike]&[/strike] firmly, [strike]so as to[/strike] lest it should
squeak, & went in, [strike]to the[/strike] pursing her lips slightly, as if
to prevent herself before she had spoken from speaking aloud.
But it was not needed.
She was annoyed.
There was
James wide awake, &
Mildred
[strike]in her[/strike] out of bed.

It was the skull again. She had told Mildred to move it, but
Mildred, of course, had forgotten; & now there was Cam wide awake
in her bed, ?& James wide awake in his, because Cam woke up
it
terrified by [strike]the shadows[/strike], & [strike]James of course[/strike] to James it was the
apple of his eye. [strike]Indeed[/strike] It was a horrid thing - a [strike]wil[/strike] boar's

had let James have it, [strike]na[/strike] & it had been nailed to the wall, &
[strike]wha[/strike] then of course this happened; [strike]they ?bitter quarrelled,[/strike]
[strike]So[/strike] Mrs. Ramsay said could they not take it down?
But [strike]it was[/strike] nailed to the wall, Mildred [strike]to[/strike] said.
Then
Cam must go to sleep & dream of lovely palaces, said Mrs.
Ramsay sitting down [strike]on her bed[/strike] by her side. [strike]No:[/strike]
[strike]because if)[/strike] she knew it was there she must see it. said Cam
And it was true. Wherever they put the nightlight (&
how could Mildred sleep without a light in the room? [strike])[/strike]
[strike]she was[/strike] afraid of beetles) [strike]one saw the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike]
[strike]shadow of the tusks, as Cam said.[/strike] there was always a
shadow somewhere.
[strike]Poor old pig, said Mrs. Ram[/strike]
   "It was only an old pig" said Mrs. Ramsay, a

liked [strike]the[/strike] pigs" [strike]at the farm.[/strike]
Cam was terrified; Cam
hated shadows; Cam could
see the tusks whichever side she
lay.
[strike]She must shut her eyes & think of birds &[/strike]
[strike]flowers & beautiful butterflies.[/strike]
   Well, then, said Mrs. Ramsay, [strike]it must[/strike] we will
cover it up." & [strike]she[/strike] they all watched her, going to the
chest of drawers, & opening [strike]first the short drawer, &[/strike]
[strike]shutting[/strike] [strike]looking in, & shutting it, & then opening the[/strike]
[strike]long drawer & taking[/strike] out [strike]a[/strike] the little drawers
quickly & not seeing what she wanted, & then
quickly taking her shawl & winding it round the

skull, & [strike]making it sound & comfortable, & ?wra[/strike]
wrapping it round & round & round, & then she went back to Cam,
& laid her head down almost on the pillow, & said Oh how
lovely it looked - how the fairies would love it. It was like a great
bird's nest now. And it was, rather. Or it was like a great
mountain, [strike]with[/strike] such as Mrs. Ramsay had seen in
Switzerland, with beautiful villages, full of flowers, &
birds singing, & little [strike]girls with[/strike] girls, & little cottages with
Cam looked &
smoke going up &
[strike]What[/strike] her mother said was
saw
that
true; it was like a mountain & a birds nest & a hanging
garden [strike]on the side of a cif cliff, & birds[/strike] & a cloud, &
And now James has got what he wanted, said Mrs. Ramsay
& she promised she
would go to sleep
& dream of
mountains,
gardens & beautiful
birds
"And everything that
is [strike]lovely;[/strike] & stream, &
crossing over to his bed, & he must go to sleep at once.
But he wanted to [strike]say[/strike] ask her something. [strike]It was[/strike]
She
suddenly remembered what it was going to be - it was
about the Lighthouse of course.
Did she think they would
go to the Lighthouse tomorrow? [strike]sh[/strike] he asked
?No not
She thought that they would not go tomorrow but she
thought [strike]that they would[/strike] go soon.
The very first
parrots, &
Mrs. Ramsay
repeated, slower -
slower, more &
more mechanically,
until Cam's
eyes shut,
fine day she said.
   Feeling for her shawl, & remembering that she had
wrapped it round the boars [strike]h[/strike] skull, she [strike]to[/strike] [strike]went,[/strike] got up, &
stopping a moment to see that they had both lain
down [strike]that[/strike] & [strike]shut[/strike] Mildred was in bed, she
once more coming to see
thought that the window was not wide enough open, -
so [strike]?crossed[/strike] & pulling it down another inch or two &
[strike]hearing the wave[/strike] so that she heard, more loudly, the
waves falling & got a [strike]little[/strike] breath of the [strike]sweet[/strike]
the cold untainted night air she[strike] left[/strike] murmured good
night & left the room, saying to herself, as she shut
into ?the ?lock
the door "that is good Charles running up to his
work" & she only hoped, as she let the tongue of the
door slowly lengthen itself, that, [strike]necess[/strike] he
would not
bump & bang above the nursery,
[strike]for she thought[/strike]
142
11
[strike]going downstairs again, necessary though it is that[/strike]
[strike]he should win his fellowship[/strike]
& waken the children, who were so easily woken, &
he did
drop things on the floor she thought
making up a
little scene of ?C T

for they neither of them slept well. They were excitable children, &
Charles Tansley - she instantly saw him [strike]in his[/strike] & thought that
he
had
[strike]she[/strike] [strike]had[/strike]
actually knocked over a pile of books which were
he had picked them up
?on his little writing table in the window; & [strike]undid his collar, yes,[/strike]
at his table
[strike]for[/strike] then sat down, [strike]rather grimly,[/strike] [[strike]?],[/strike] [strike]poor young[/strike] man; [strike]he[/strike]
poor young man to
work as usual
when
all the others were
enjoying
themselves
[strike]had not succeeded in impressing himself upon anybody at[/strike]
[strike]dinner, beside his candles, he & said to himself felt very[/strike]
[strike]lonely & really, if she could have thought of an excuse for going to[/strike]
[strike]him she would have done so. but[/strike] He looked
& she would have gone into him, but [strike]rem[/strike] reflecting, with one half of
her brain that [strike]this was her invention[/strike] - he had not knocked
that
all
over his books - [strike]she next[/strike] it was her invention - she
[strike]reproached herself for[/strike] thought herself silly for exaggerating as
usual, reflected that no power on earth could [strike]give[/strike]
after all help him to acquire those graces which were so
attractive in Paul Rayley, & heaven [strike]pro[/strike] had provided a
substitute in moral philosophy or John Stuart Mill
so that all things considered it might be better to leave him.
Yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow,
yet she would feel relieved when he went, yet he was very good
with her husband,
yet his manners certainly wanted improving,
observing too that now she could see the moon itself[strike], &[/strike]
through the staircase window, - the shadowy [strike]dinted[/strike] much
dinted moon - she turned from all this to the very next
moment - Prue & Andrew, Paul & Minta, all opening doors &
coming out into the hall; muffled.
   [strike]Looking[/strike] Coming down stairs, looking out of the window,
then turning [strike]& at once[/strike] Prue saw her mother & felt at
again they
once [strike]two things[/strike] - [strike]that[/strike] how she was a child,
[strike]& she[/strike] had been
feeling extremely old; how that was the crown &
grace of life, her mother coming down stairs, & they all
knew it. Yes; Minta should look at her; Paul should look at her:
143
15
For, she felt, in a way which she could not describe, Here is
the thing itself - her mother [strike]being to her[/strike] having only to appear
to make Prue feel that what they had been playing at was now
[strike][?][/strike] ordered; their going sanctioned, or if not, condemned,
& as nobody else in the kingdom had Mrs. Ramsay for a
mother, this was Minta's great chance, & Paul's - And
her beauty, too, to Prue, always seemed to [strike]be saying to them all,[/strike]
stamp the moment, & she was a little afraid of her, &
actually to
ennoble it,
was her slave, & would never grow up [[strike]?][/strike] or leave home, with
her there, & never wanted to, but only to come out into the
hall & see her coming downstairs, & say to her,
   "We thought of going down to the beach", & [strike]hear[/strike] her
hear
[strike]see[/strike]
sum up the position instantly, [strike]ha[/strike] debate it, should they go, or
should they not go? & ?then decide with that mood of
revelry & [strike][?rather][/strike] which was delicious in her, [strike][?][/strike] & made her
the soul of any junketing, yes, it was quite right to go down to
the beach; & why not swim, & why not catch a fish ... saying
shark
[strike]?which she[/strike] [strike]pulled Mintas[/strike] fastened Minta's cloak about her,
[strike]then[/strike]
saying
& [strike]really[/strike] would have liked to come with them; but
no: there was [strike]William Bankes; there was her[/strike] - her husband,
she meant; she meant to, she wanted to sit down in a
particular chair, under a particular lamp, & taking up her
knitting - [strike]a book[/strike] take up her book.
   They must really not be late she said.
   Had anybody got a watch?
   Paul Rayley of course had a beautiful gold watch,
which he took out of a little washleather bag; & seeing that
bag, Mrs. Ramsay felt how extraordinarily lucky Minta was -
to marry a man who kept a watch in a bag; so she
went into the drawingroom.
   Slightly annoyed about Andrew
144
17
because it was
so foolish
in its
absurdity
The thought, which of course she would not say to anyone, tickled her secretly
& with a smile on her lips she went into the drawing room, where, to her
surprise, there was only her husband, reading.
   However, he did not want to be interrupted - that was clear;
[strike]from[/strike] He was reading - what? something that moved
him,
[strike]to a ?som ?inter[/strike] for [strike]with h[/strike]
besides being intent he was all the time half smiling, & then
as she knew [strike][?][/strike] controlling
his emotion, & yet all the time he
was discriminating & not allowing himself to be unduly
influenced, ?but & weighing one thing with another:
"The Antiquary" - dear old Sir Walter, she thought, smiling [strike]&[/strike]
no longer
[strike]but with[/strike] [strike]?no ?longer[/strike] irresponsibly [strike]anymore;[/strike] ?& sitting down
under her lamp, in her chair, opposite, & taking up her knitting.
For Charles Tansley (instinctively she listened to hear [strike]him[/strike]
of books
bump & bang upon the floor) said he was done for: then
her husband thought,
went & [?]
"That is what they will say of me";
wh he
so he
got The Antiquary, [strike]he[/strike] loved [strike]The Antiquary, but[/strike]
[strike]nothing would ever make him tamper with truth;[/strike] [strike]he would[/strike]
[strike]He might want a thing to be true; but[/strike]
[strike]If he found it[/strike]
But
If his reason told him that it was true - Sir Walter was done for -
then
very well
he would accept that fact:
Except about himself, he
[strike]was rational[/strike] would
accept anything.
Not liking to
think why he was
so irrational about himself so that perhaps
other people, Lily for instance, had guessed at dinner [strike]how[/strike]
why he was so irritable [strike]at dinner[/strike] when they talked about
fame & books lasting, not liking [strike]to[/strike] the sense she had
sometimes
the
that [strike]his[/strike] children wondered, a little, she began her knitting, &
at the same time all those fine [strike]points[/strike] gravings, as with
steel instruments, became drawn again about her
lips & forehead, & she became [strike]like an image which[/strike]
[strike]owing to her beauty,[/strike] [strike]like[/strike] still, & composed, [strike]as if all[/strike]
like a tree which has been tossed & quivering & now, when
the breeze falls, settles into quiet.
   But [strike]then[/strike]
How great a mind he has, she thought.
very much; [strike]& why did it move[/strike]
[strike]him;[/strike]
145
19
She could not judge his mind indeed; [strike]but[/strike] Nor was it intellect, exactly; it was
his way with him; his loftiness; His truthfulness, His - & feeling
rise up in her that same feeling which she had had at dinner
which
[strike]the brooding calm of a[/strike]
soul
?riding the waves, [strike]which[/strike] in a brooding [strike]calm,[/strike]
peace, & [strike]yet[/strike] then somebody begins, the China rose is all abloom &
buzzing with the yellow bee, [strike]come out[/strike] & all the lives we ever
lived & all the lives to be, come out, come out - she
she felt herself
like a leaf
blowing [strike]through a[/strike]
in at a window
[strike]took[/strike] looked over her knitting at the books on her little table, &
took one, an anthology of poems, & opened it [strike]anywhere[/strike], laying it
on her knee,
[strike]And[/strike] [strike]n[/strike]Never reading at all, except in this way,
[strike]she turned leaves,[/strike]
turning leaves, climbing from this to that, she
had not any
[strike]sense of[/strike] security whatever, or any knowledge even, [strike]but[/strike]
of names, but only [strike]how the[/strike] [strike]that the[/strike] [strike]lines[/strike] [strike]about the[/strike]
[strike]sonnets of Shakespeare[/strike] -
felt it a great relief; & [strike]at the[/strike]

[strike]She [?] read some poetry every night or the Opium Eater.[/strike]
her world being overarched in the evenings, [strike]by[/strike] by this [strike]strange poetry world[/strike]
strangeness;
And she kept turning over the pages & knitting
rhythmically, & looking now & then at her husband, who still
did not want to be interrupted, for he was being led on, like a fool,
to
waste
his time.

[strike]That old[/strike] [strike]They said nobody read it now.[/strike] [strike]And[/strike] there was no

muttered
[strike]shutting the book.[/strike] [strike]rather flushed,[/strike] [strike]rather excited.[/strike] [strike]& rather[/strike]
[strike]ashamed of himself.[/strike] Turning the page, but he did not mind.
It was a splendid chapter; the humour was magnificent. And
[strike]if[/strike] after all, one need not attend to the love making seriously -
it was the old beggar & the old [strike]peasant[/strike] [strike]wish[/strike] wives; he
fish
could not help mouthing the Scotch dialect to himself
146
21
He felt fortified, & forgot completely the little rubs & digs of the evening; [strike][?][/strike] its
exasperations & intolerable boredom, feeling now [strike]that[/strike] invigorated by this man's
strength & sanity & his [strike]feeling[/strike] [strike]certainty that[/strike] belief in the straightforward
simple things, which Mr. Ramsay felt so strongly that, when it came to [strike]the[/strike]
poor Steenie's drowning, [strike]the[/strike] he could not choke down his tears, [strike]&[/strike]
but raising the book a little, [strike]sat[/strike] let them fall, & shook his head from
side to side, & forgot completely what he was doing, save for the
sense of his wife there who must not interrupt him - & was
keeping from him he was obscurely conscious, intolerable bores.
Let
them
[strike]It was done.[/strike]
[strike]If they were going to[/strike] improve upon that, he
in his
sympathy &
sorrow for the
[strike]poor old pa[/strike]
poor old
parents
thought, [strike]finishing[/strike] as he finished the chapter. [strike]And[/strike] Immediately,
he began thinking, how it was the old beggars & fishwives Scott was
man
good at; [strike]how[/strike] the lovers were fiddlesticks.
The innocence [strike]of the[/strike]
man was [strike]incred[/strike] astonishing.
He was contemporary with
Balzac after all. But if it [strike]hampered him[/strike] limited him his
lack of interest in these eternal sex problems was also a [strike]source of[/strike]
[strike]th[/strike] one reason for his ?vigour. Mr. Ramsay felt that sex interest was
hugely overdone. If this sort of thing seemed old fashioned to the
young men, [strike]that[/strike] naturally they did not buy his [strike]own[/strike] books,
Mr. Ramsay thought; ?& One ought not to complain; [strike]Here he[/strike]
[strike]looked at his wife,[/strike] if they did not read Scott. Here he looked
at his wife, who was reading & knitting, but, like a person in a
very light sleep, was conscious of the very moment that her
husband shut his book. [strike]She was[/strike] He [strike]often jus[/strike] liked just to look at her
He liked to think that everyone had taken themselves off, & he & she were
alone; [strike]just[/strike] for ten minutes or so
   Mrs. Ramsay raised her head, but like a person in a
light sleep, seemed to [strike]ask[/strike] say that if he wanted her to wake she
would, otherwise she was sleeping. She was rocking; she was
stretched
[strike]sa[/strike] [strike]brooding; on the rhythm, in the[/strike] mesh [strike]stretched tight[/strike] of Shakespeare's
sonnets.
   Well? he said at length. [strike]And[/strike] [strike]At once[/strike] quizzically,
as if he were ridiculing her gently, for being asleep in broad
daylight, [strike]but[/strike] & at the same time hiding the delight of her
147
23
her presence & the immeasurable comfort of her beauty, for he
wrong
thought, it was silly to [strike]think that he had[/strike] reproach himself. [strike][?][/strike]
Neither of them would have lived differently; [strike]he[/strike] to him, [strike]worn as she[/strike]
she was more beautiful now; worn & old; worried; teased; driven to
death with all these people.
   She woke instantly.
Could they have lived differently?
Well, she said, echoing him [strike]dr[/strike] dreamily.
She tried to remember all
that had happened since she had seen him alone: the dinner, & the
& Paul's
watch;
engagement, & the children being awake, & Andrew [strike]in the hall[/strike]
silent
Andrew being so [strike]stiff w[/strike]
[strike]shy[/strike] with her: & what else?
now
   [strike]They have gone down to the beach she said,[/strike]
[strike]She shut he[/strike] Her book shut itself on her knee.
Mr. Ramsay said
the engagement he meant.
that he supposed they had hit it off - [strike]he divined something of the sort.[/strike]
It all seemed to have happened a long time ago; [strike]or[/strike] it seemed [strike]as if[/strike]
[strike]to have become part of their own lives,[/strike]
[strike]But how explain that[/strike]
[strike]feeling? as if Mrs. Ramsay thought,[/strike] It seemed to her that it had
already melted in to the [strike]great[/strike] [strike]thick[/strike] [strike]trunk of[/strike] fabric of
their lives, [strike]&[/strike] like a stream which eddies [strike]round[/strike] at first & then
rushes along in the main current.
She felt that there was
nothing to be said about it.
She felt, especially when she had
?start ?nothing
been reading poetry, [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]how[/strike] little could be said, &
[strike]that[/strike] not ?rightly; & she was coming to shrink from talk more
joking
& more - not light gossip of course or fun
about
(that Paul had a
wash leather bag for his watch) but [strike]who could say what she[/strike]
[strike]felt now?[/strike] about other things - her relationship with her husband, &
the children, & one thing happening & then another things, & the
sense she had that it was all, somehow, right; & yet so

   It grew darker. Clouds covered the moon, & in the early hours
of the morning [strike]the[/strike] a light rain drummed on the roof, &

[strike]doors of[/strike] swallowed up here the [strike]glint[/strike] white of china &

When
everything was confused & confounded, there was scarcely

As if the least cover were too heavy, & the mattress [strike]m[/strike]

now betake themselves to the staircase, [strike]for exam[/strike] to the window
for example; they would nose & rub & fumble the pane;
descending, ruffle the [strike]light[/strike] cloaks in the hall, &
then meditate how to chill the apples in the plate on the
dining room table. Grey dew might bead their [strike]round[/strike] redness, -

a hope
not founded on reason, not founded surely on satisfaction (for
of the town[?]
she was the butt &
outcast) but founded perhaps
([strike]here[/strike]
[strike]as her wits were half crazed[/strike], all conjecture must be
(her cheeks were
yellow & old)
distorted) on the dumb persistency of the fountain of life, &
on moments (say they came obscurely, here & there, at the
wash tub, [strike]in[/strike] with her children who had gone now to
America) [strike]of which[/strike] [strike]breathed[/strike] of illumination, when the

[strike]standing at her & she & it was some the gift of life[/strike]

[strike]great poets have said whatever it may be that then[/strike]
whatever it may be:

a channel were tunnelled in the heart of obscurity, &
[strike]the meaning[/strike] & through the rift they made [strike]&[/strike]
there issued peace, enough, when the grind & the
grit returned, to sweeten that barrenness; for
[strike]strangely as[/strike] in her sidelong glance there was,

she had been drunk in her day, & of her six children, two, it was
said were not by her husband; she had lived, she had loved, in
short, & if consolation came to her it was of some
warmer, subtler kind. Perhaps she had an open heart, a

   Was it, then, that she had her consolation in [strike]moments[/strike] of
[strike]illumination[/strike], when with the breeze in the west & the
clouds white in the sun she stood at her cottage door;
for what reason did there twine about the dirge this
incorrigible hope?, & [strike]how [/strike]why, with no gift to
bestow a no gift to take, did she yet desire life, &
sing, as she dusted & leered [?][strike]how[/strike] Were there then
for Mrs. MacNab, trodden into the mud by civilisation,
a mat for kings & kaisers to walk on, moments of
illumination - at the
washtub, say, with her children?
(Yet two
of them at had been base-born, & three had
deserted her) Some cleavage of the clouds there must have
been; some channel cut in the heart of obscurity through
which issued light enough to make her grin like that - looking
at herself in the long looking glass; & [strike]seeing there a[/strike]
[strike]wisp of[/strike] with her homy[?] forgive, tolerate, understand.
The crazed, the mystic, the visionary are possessed at
long intervals of comprehension, & find in them
some absolute good so that a lump of sugar more
or less matters nothing; they are warm in the frost &
have comforts in the desert.
But Mrs. MacNab was
not of these.
She was not among the [strike]haters of life; not[/strike] among the
skeleton lovers; not among those who voluntarily surrender
[strike]their[/strike], make abstract, [strike]& find in some s[/strike]

unity & its volume & conflict & anguish to one
voice piping clear & [strike]single[/strike] sweet. [strike]Th[/strike] [strike]Thus, when all the[/strike]
[strike]mysti[/strike] When the inspired & lofty minded, who had walked on

walked on the beach & heard, in some lull of the storm, a
voice, seen a vision, & so [strike]inte[/strike] mounting the
pulpit interpreted the
[?]senseless
& made public how [strike]simple everything is, &[/strike] it is - to love, to worship,
Mrs. MacNab, continued [strike]to muddle things up down below.[/strike]
& drink & gossip [strike]down[/strike] as before[strike].[/strike]: [strike]&[?][/strike]
[strike]s[?] And it seemed[/strike]
as if [strike]the true duty of[/strike] it were in the muddle [strike]&[/strike] of
[strike]un[/strike] & inexplicability of things, the struggle & the [strike]weariness[/strike]
tiredness, [strike]the search the[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] that she discovered [strike]not[/strike]
those reasons which she never divulged for [strike]carryi[/strike] opening
the windows & dusting the bedrooms: as if her message to a
world now beginning to burst into the [strike]in[/strike] [strike]w[/strike]
voluntary/loveliness of spring were somehow transmitted
rather by the lurch of the body & the leer of her smile, [strike]by her[/strike]
[strike]than by[/strike] & in them were the broken syllables of a
revelation more [strike]profound, but[/strike] confused, but more
profound
than any accorded to solitary watchers, pacers on the
beach at midnight, [strike]anguished so[/strike] [?] preachers &
diviners.
   Yet to them[strike], too[/strike], as the evenings lengthened [strike]again,[/strike]
[strike]there[/strike] came the strangest intimations, [strike]as if the[/strike]
[strike]su[/strike]
the most authentic beckonings,
[strike]as if[/strike], in the sunset &
the sunrise, in the windy evenings,

must needs fly
with arms stretched to the

[strike]It seemed[/strike] as if the wave were [strike]them[/strike], [strike]break[/strike] so

[strike]all[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]all this purity & fierceness,[/strike] & the tree's strength & the

brought together purposely, to body forth a might [strike]which[/strike]

were so brought together to assemble the scattered parts of the [strike]faith he[/strike] of the
[strike]he[/strike] vision within them. Now displayed [strike]outside them it wa[/strike]
in sky & wind
& what was
in cliff & sea, [strike]what they[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] the thing seemed manifest, outside, & inside,
made
[strike]miraculously[/strike] [strike]seemed[/strike] miraculously one.
   For a week at the end of May this unity [strike]was[/strike] persisted
[strike]&[/strike] The spring without a lea leaf to toss [strike]or a bough to[/strike]
very bare & bright presented itself like a virgin fierce in her
chastity contemptuous in her purity; [strike]&[/strike] [strike]was there,[/strike] in the
[strike]very[/strike]
fields & on the sea,
heartless & [strike]if it were not for[/strike] the
as if
[strike]dreams & desires of the beholders, apparently[/strike] entirely
wide eyed
watchful
laid out,
unconcerned with [strike]their[/strike] [strike]what was done or thought or hoped or[/strike]
feared. [strike]Beauty, she[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]with the dreams & desires of the[/strike]
[strike]beholders[/strike]. with what was done or thought; [strike]by the beholders.[/strike] by the beholders.
[strike]as if the[/strike] Nevertheless, [strike]thes[/strike] [strike]th[?][/strike] dreams persisted; &
it was impossible[strike],[/strike] [strike]so str[/strike] to resist the strange intimation which
&
every gull & flower, [strike]the[/strike] trees - the bright pure earth itself
seemed to declare, but if [strike]one[/strike] questioned [strike]them[/strike] at once to
then
withdraw, [strike]as[/strike] [strike]as to[/strike] the triumph of good, the universality of
things
happiness; [strike]the[/strike] [strike]& again[/strike] or to resist the extraordinary
us
to
stimul[strike]ation[/strike], which seemed urg[strike]ing the one to seek a[/strike]
[strike]people[/strike] hither & thither as if in search of some good, some
hard crystal it [strike]might[/strike] be, entirely remote from [strike]their[/strike]
pleasures
[strike]n[/strike] known & familiar [strike]pleasures &[/strike] virtues; something
altogether alien to the processes of domestic life; something
bright & fierce & hard, [strike]let f[/strike] a crystal laid on a sandy
floor, a diamond glittering in the white dust.
And then,
suddenly, as it seemed conquered & acquiescent, softened now
& tender, the spring seemed to the watchers & pacers who
were seeking a revelation to have knowledge of [strike]their[/strike]
tears: [strike]to[/strike] cloudy, to have compassion, [strike]& all[/strike]
singing
[strike]echoing with birds voices[/strike] & [strike]boys whis[/strike] bees humming & the

the watchers

to have taken on a knowledge of their doubts, of their sufferings,
veiling herself, & [strike]sending blue[/strike] bending her head, & [strike]letting[/strike] her
[strike]compassionate gaze fall[/strike] brooding, in beautiful transient melancholy, in
[strike]sp[?][/strike] flying shadows, in sprinkles of [strike]sof[/strike] small rain,
   Now again when spring was far advanced it was possible to
attempt the house [strike]again[/strike]; [strike]with allies - flies, gnats, spiders, sm wh[?][/strike]
& now[?]
[strike]for allies, so that[/strike] when the wind [strike]& the[/strike] began to breathe & the
shawls & coats to move
[strike]a[/strike]
[strike]there moved with them a[/strike]
with them round & round
flies buzzed in the sun, & there could be heard [strike][?]th[/strike] tapping at the
tall
green
long windows [strike]some[/strike] the leaves of some [strike]quickly shooting[/strike] plant.
The the [strike]light[/strike] stroke of the lighthouse, which had laid itself

with authority upon the [strike]mat[/strike] carpet when the nights were dark,
gliding

stealthily, [strike][?][/strike] as if it laid its caress [strike]upon[/strike] & lingered was [strike]came[/strike]

But in the midst of this
loving caress, for no reason, - except perhaps that the damp
had loosened it imperceptibly, & the [strike]w[/strike] wind
dislodged it, the shawl burst asunder. Another fold [strike]was[/strike]
had fallen. A long streamer now hung from the
boar's skull & was fanned gently, this way & that way,
in those short spring nights, full of [strike]sl[/strike] [strike]s[/strike] [strike]mo[/strike] [strike]light[/strike] [strike]fro[/strike]
silver from the moon & the lighthouse, & those hot
days, when the grasses scarcely tapped upon the pane, &
only one tortoise shell butterfly dashed from window to
window.

   Now again the wind breathed in the house, flies buzzed round in the
winds
warm yellow spot of sunshine, & [strike]there[/strike] could be heard,
weeds
tapping the window pane, long [strike]grasses[/strike], stray wild flowers,
which had grown close to the glass in the night.
When darkness fell, the stroke of the lighthouse which had
laid itself with authority upon the carpet when the nights
were dark came mixed with moonlight gliding gently &
stealthily as if it laid its caress/ & lingered & looked & went  &
came lovingly again. ...
on the empty
bed
The curved tooth on the lower jaw of the skull was [strike]unc[/strike] laid bare;
& then the [strike]strea[/strike] shawl, which now hung down like a streamer,
waved gently this way & that, throughout the short spring
nights [strike]& the silver robed by the moon & the lighthouse,[/strike] &
the long summer days when all the empty rooms seemed
to [strike]hum with[/strike] murmur [strike]with the[/strike] with the echoes[?] of the

them with a [strike]liquid[/strike] yellow that Mrs MacNab, when she
hazy
came to dust, looked like a tropical fish, oaring
[strike]her w[/strike] its way through [strike]the[/strike] sun-lanced [strike]water[/strike] sea.
[strike]Up rose the bookcases[/strike] [strike]like[/strike] rocks; [strike]the tables floated like[/strike] islands;
among
[strike]strange[/strike] corals & crystals. [strike]glowed & twinkled on the[/strike]
But slumber though it might without apparent change [strike]through[/strike]
[strike]ran for a[/strike] as [strike]the[/strike] there came later in the summer ominous
sounds [strike]which,[/strike] thuds, rumbles, like [strike]regular[/strike] thunder
regularly repeated, which with their repeated shocks still

this brilliance, this complete indifference.
   Then [strike]the escaped,[/strike] indeed those who had gone down to pace
they
the beach & ask of the sea & sky what message
[strike]it[/strike] reported or
they
affirmed
what vision [strike]it[/strike] [strike]made manifest[/strike], had to consider among
[strike][?][/strike] the usual & the delightful tokens of diving bounty -
such as the sunset on the sea & the colour of the waves
& their frolic & their grandeur  & the the majesty of
the cliffs - something unexpected. For instance, a
the calm

rising
murderous looking ship; [strike]would appear, or,[/strike] leaden, ashen,

This intrusion into a scene [strike]which was[/strike] otherwise

When in spring the flowers [strike]all started[/strike],

Mrs. Macnab stooped & picked a bunch to take home with her;
[strike]as she went in to air the rooms[/strike] she laid them on the table
[strike]when she[/strike] while she did her dusting.
Suppose the
house was sold, it would want doing up. For there it had
stood all these years without a soul in it; now, [strike]according to one[/strike]
&
[strike]of the young la[/strike] would Mrs. Macnab see that [strike]the[/strike]
everything was straight - for it might be sold, Mrs. Macnab
understood, to a gentleman from Edinburgh.
After all these years, the books & things were mouldy
for what with the war, [strike]& one thing & another[/strike], help
being hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as she
could have wished. The books were mouldy; & the
plaster had fallen in the hall;

grey
[strike]not[/strike] want them any more; [strike]not her this[/strike] old coat, for

dim
A [strike]little[/strike] figure, of a lady in a grey cloak, bending [strike]down[/strike] among white
flowers on a summer's [strike]night, &[/strike] evening appeared here [strike](at her[/strike]
& here & here [strike]as Mrs. Macnab went[/strike], [strike][?]as[/strike] by the open drawer [strike]of[/strike]
by the washstand, by the cupboard as Mrs. Macnab [strike]went[/strike] did
the bedroom - It was [strike]more[/strike] like an image seen through a rather
feeble telescope; [strike]it[/strike] was cut out like that - a[strike] lady in a grey cloak -[/strike]
feeling to it
without [strike]any[/strike] much else, save some queer pleasure, rising in
[strike]Mrs. Macnab's[/strike] old Maggie's brain to think of herself going up
the drive to have her tea perhaps in the kitchen on a
summer's evening when [strike]everything was[/strike] things were better than they
are now. She sighed - she moaned. The little picture
which
[strike]the ghost who[/strike] had come back to the bedroom[strike], like a[/strike]
[strike]for a moment[/strike] to waver across the wall [strike]&[/strike] like a momentary
sunbeam on a cloudy day vanished. Old Maggie saw nothing: [strike]at all.[/strike]
Compared with everything else there - the mahogany chest of
drawers - the brass bedstead - the ghost which old
Maggie had
saw only the
chest of drawers
& the brass
bedstead
which needed
polishing
[strike]Such was the fate of that [?]w ghost.[/strike]
   They survived. [strike]The[/strike] Pleasant ghosts - & she had had a way
with her, Mrs. Ramsay, - [strike]would not[/strike] could not alter those;
could not stay. It was only by fits & starts one [strike]got the[/strike]
thought of them. [strike]A la[/strike] Stooping among her flowers - old
Maggie [strike]might[/strike] say it [strike]herself, but[/strike] but her old crazed
could
wits were flitting off elsewhere; [strike]The[/strike] There was
too much here to do for one [strike]person -[/strike] woman - to do.
too much - too much.
   So, when she had gone, ill temperedly banging the doors,
& forgetting her flowers,
the house seemed like a
shell deserted of life, & given over to moulder on a sandhill.

Then the long night seemed to have set in; the final triumph
of the little airs; the clammy breath, [strike]to be[/strike] was at hand.
Soon some thistle would be thrusting its head between the tiles in
the larder; & the swallows [strike]who had nested yearly in the[/strike]

& the floor would be strewn with straws & [strike]the[/strike] plaster
would fall, & rats carry off this & that behind wainscot, &

woken from their dreams by that prodigious cannonading which
had made the wine glasses tinkle in the cupboard, or

had so gravely [strike]interfered[/strike] damaged the composition of the picture
that [strike]w[/strike] they had fled. They had gone in despair. They had
dashed the mirror to the ground. They saw nothing more.
They stumbled & strove now, blindly, pulling their feet out of the
mud & stamping them further in. Let the wind blow, let the

For now had come that moment, that crisis, [strike]in the[/strike] when if a
father alight in one scale, it will be weighted down - & so if
if a feather had [strike]blown[/strike] alighted the house would have fallen in:
would have become past repair; & [strike]out[/strike] picnickers, would have
boiled their kettles in its [strike]cr[/strike] ruined rooms, lovers [strike][?][/strike]
sought shelter there, or [strike]som[/strike] the shepherd stored his dinner, &
taken his rest there, with his collie [strike]&[/strike] by his side. Then
[strike]even the[/strike] the walls would have fallen in, & then, [strike]coming[/strike] over
nothing would have
[strike]the hill,[/strike] [strike]only the[/strike] [strike]since the tangled garden could[/strike] [strike]what would have[/strike]
remained to straying into [strike]this wilderness,[/strike] this ruined barn,
one
(for such it seemed) in a wilderness of [strike]old[/strike] unkempt shrubs,
[strike]some[/strike] the only things [?] which would have testified that [strike]here[/strike]
people had lived somewhere about here would have been
the [strike]extraordinary[/strike] apparition of a red hot poker; [strike]The[/strike] a chipped plate.
If the feather had fallen[strike],[/strike] - if it had plunged the scale into
darkness, - but there was a force working on the other side;
something leering & lurching; [strike]something[/strike] not highly conscious of its
own purpose, & certainly not inspired to go about its task with
dignified ritual or solemn chanting. But in old Maggie & her
crony, Mrs. Bast, there was a force: (they came with their
brooms & their pails, they moaned: they crooned. They got to work.)
There was a force perhaps in their craziness, [strike](for without being[/strike]
[strike]locked in danger of locking up, their minds were blank[/strike]
[strike]or vacancy of mind[/strike] which slowly & painfully [strike]began[/strike]
stayed the corruption & the rot; rescued from the
pool of time which was fast closing over them, now a bed now a
basin now a cupboard; fished up from oblivion [strike]the[/strike]
all the Waverley novels, & a tea pot one morning: in the
afternoon restored to the sun & the air a brass fender & a
set of steel pokers & tongs. Some rusted laborious birth
attended with the creaking hinges & the screeching of bolts &
ask them what
the war had
been about -
did they know?)
something that was

& the slamming & banging of damp-swollen wood [strike]might[/strike]
[strike]have been[/strike] [strike]been[/strike] seemed to be taking place, as the old women
slapped & slammed, upstairs now, now in the cellar.
They drank their tea in the bathroom sometimes, sometimes in the
study; contemplating now, the magnificent conquest of the taps &
the freshly painted bath; now their more arduous &
indeed more partial [strike]conq[/strike] [strike]triump[/strike] [strike]c[/strike] triumph over
innumerable volumes of [strike]old[/strike] philosophy which, black in the
beginning, were now not only puce [strike][?][/strike] coloured [strike]& white[/strike]
with white cascades of damp, but bred little mushrooms -
[strike]seret[/strike] secreted spiders.
[strike]Then,[/strike] suddenly, [strike]her[/strike] as she wiped
[strike]& ba[/strike] them, the telescope fitted itself of its own accord to old
Maggie's wandering eyes, & in a momentary stability she saw
the old gentleman, on the lawn. [strike]He was[/strike] as lean as a rake - He
it wa
[strike]was[/strike] wagging his head. [strike]He[/strike] Was he dead too?
[strike]Some[/strike] said [strike]he,[/strike]
Mr. Ramsay
it was Mr.
Ramsay.
some said [strike]she[/strike] He was standing on the lawn;
she could
see him now.
So for a moment the little ghost, held in the charwoman's eye,
revisited the lawn, wagged its head; & recalled [strike]that[/strike] ([strike]who kne[/strike] by some
devious faith) [strike]he[/strike] a joke of Mildreds in the kitchen.
She was
always
hot tempered like all red haired women. [strike]But[/strike] She saved [strike]her[/strike]
a plate of milk soup for Maggie. Mrs. Ramsay quite thought she
needed it, bringing the wash up the hill every step of the way
herself.

which had done very fairly since there was only one square [strike]army of[/strike]
of thick[strike][?][/strike] waving grass yet to be demolished on the lawn
while the [strike]ba[/strike] behind him the shining grass lay prone; the
the curt stubble was crisp. He [strike]brought order &[/strike]
laid low the wilderness with each sweep, & to do him justice was a
steady worker, slow but remorseless, as if each movement were
issued
timed by [strike]an accurate[/strike]
[strike]sent out by the shock of[/strike] his heart, &
from
(a powerful but
[strike]not a[/strike] inarticulate
organ)
sucked in & sent out; so that even now he would waste no
words with the women in the window, only grinned & spat, & resumed
again that rhythmic singsong stroke, which [strike]was[/strike]
advanced like the sweep of an invincible army ove the
& wary
insugr insurgents rioting [strike]before[/strike]
in their tumult [strike]b[/strike] up the
bank & over the lawn & [strike]so[/strike] laid them flat.
   When, at [strike]six[/strike] in the evening, & the pale green swathes
lay twined with convolvulus [strike]or[/strike] wild flowers on the lawn,
&
when the rooks were deliberating, fastidiously, tentatively,
among the tree tops, & [strike]from[/strike] again like some half

At last, [strike]there came in the evening, the when George[/strike] all the labour
stopped: [strike]cloth[/strike] dusters were flicked from the windows: the windows shut;
[strike]were[/strike]
banged to,
keys turned,
they locked the doors, George [strike]shouldered[/strike] his [strike]syth[/strike] stopped, [strike]a[/strike] automatically
still; & then at once, as if the cleaning & the [strike]sy[/strike] [strike]sy[/strike] scything had
[strike]du[/strike] [strike]dulled[/strike] the sound, [strike]began that half heard melody[/strike] with the
rooks deliberat[strike]e[/strike]ing fastidiously tentatively among the tree tops,
that half heard melody, that adumbrated music which
the ear half catches but lets fall - cries, shouts, bark, far or close at hand -
so widely spaced
is it, & half close &
half faint, half
here, & half
far away,
[strike]wrapped up in the mesh of summer stillness & suddenly[/strike]
[strike]h[/strike] was [strike]heard, & lost, & that music began[/strike], & then the [strike]rooks,[/strike]
creaking of the rooks joined with it, - rising fully deliberating
above the tree tops, & then the insects cheeped & then the
where it lay
the cut grass started & shiver[strike]s[/strike]ed [strike]ran through it,[/strike] but
[strike]always with notes were dropped, &[/strike] & gradually, with the
sunset, [strike]peace[/strike] sharpness was lost; & like a mist rising,
quiet rose, the rooks settled, the grass settled[strike].[/strike], [strike]At[/strike]
[strike]ease, & loosened loose,[/strike] [strike]Freedom & ease, content & peace[/strike] was the
[strike]lot of the[/strike] whole world shaking itself down to sleep, darkly
& palely caught by flowers.
   [strike]Then, in the darkness, the [?]unl restless spirits who[/strike]
[strike]had left their beds to ask what fate meant, what God meant, to[/strike]
[strike]what destiny the ball of the world rolled, could once more[/strike]

Then [strike]when[/strike] calm had returned[strike],[/strike]. Peaceful messages breathed from the
waves [strike]on the beach, &[/strike] to the house. Never to break its
sleep again, [strike]never to to[/strike] to lull it rather more calmly, [strike]no[/strike] more
there, in bed,
sweetly to rest. What ever they
dream holily wisely, we confirm; -
what else were they murmuring?
And behold, - [strike]yes[/strike]
[strike]Indeed,[/strike] their message, their wisdom, no sooner was it
thought than they wore it a garment of splendour;
[strike]cast it like a[/strike] swept it [strike]over[/strike] [strike]swirled it, & they[/strike] the
wave swept up the beach. Then, like a [strike]th[/strike] mind so

deep in contemplation that its least thought it [strike]full, & is returning to[/strike]

Each wave [strike]seemed to[/strike] added, if one walked there, with the

   [strike]"[/strike]Then what does it mean, what can it mean?" Lily Briscoe asked
all
herself, wondering whether, since they had all disappeared, it
behoved her to go to the kitchen for another cup of coffee or to
wait here. So [strike]inappropriately[/strike], [strike]by[/strike] using a catchword picked up
a
from some book or other she tried [strike]to[/strike] [strike]contract her myriad emotions,[/strike]
this first morning at the Ramsays [strike]again[/strike], to contract her myriad
emotions; to make some phrase resound where there was nothing,
with [?]
to cover the blankness of her mind. For really what did one feel?
Nothing ?nothing
[strike]At this[/strike] moment, not much. She had arrived [strike]rather[/strike] late [strike]the[/strike] night;
& dark & strange
was
When it
[strike]It had been[/strike] very beautiful, & not real. Now she was awake: sitting
at the breakfast table
in her old place, [strike]at ?Mr. Ramsay's right hand[/strike].
It was very early —

not quite eight. They were going to the Lighthouse —
shd have
Mr. Ramsay, Cam & James. They had to be off [strike]to catch the[/strike]
[strike]tide,[/strike] [strike]early:[/strike] they had to catch the tide, or something: [strike]& they were late.[/strike]
Cam was not ready
[strike]So[/strike] Mr. Ramsay had lost [strike]his temper[/strike] So James was not ready;
Nancy had forgotten the sandwiches, or something. & So Mr.
Ramsay had lost his temper. There he was marching up &
?slamming
down on the terrace outside. [strike]&[/strike] One could hear doors banging all
to order
& barged out 
of the
room
over the house, & [strike]once[/strike] Nancy had burst in, [strike]with all sorts of[/strike] things

or a pair of scissors

[strike]probably was[/strike] not.
For [strike]how ?co[/strike] who was going to answer her question?
[strike]On[/strike] At an ordinary time, Lily could have concentrated her mind &
thought of [strike]tea[/strike] tobacco, [strike]chocolate,[/strike] comforters - but [strike]it[/strike] nothing was

[strike][/strike][strike]so vivid, so real: & ?close & glaring.[/strike] & yet unrelated; as if she
why indeed [strike]h[/strike] did anything happen as it did happen?
For she had no attachments or relations it seemed; she was [strike]set down[/strike]
[strike]here among[/strike] sitting among clean cups at a long table alone.
& for a moment, [strike]with extreme[/strike] vividness, felt cut off from all

quality —
 it was

[strike]As if at last ?one saw the extraordinary nature of existence,[/strike]
[strike]was made plain, & one could some little as if some[/strike]
[strike]link had broken.[/strike] As if some link had broken & at last one
realised how extraordinary it was —
How aimless, how
chaotic, how violent, she thought — & really,
whatever one might
say,
almost entirely without
or thought or anything
feeling or reason.
There was Mrs.
Ramsay dead,
Andrew killed; Prue dead too:
Then they all got together & [strike]said[/strike]
[strike]had breakfast, & Mr. Ramsay[/strike] like this in a house on a bay [strike]& began[/strike]
by [?why]?
poured out coffee [strike]at eight in the morning[/strike]
But
[strike]Heaven knows what its all about,[/strike] &
she had to keep saying to
is
this is tragic
herself [strike]what a tragedy,[/strike] [strike]now[/strike] terrible this is, how [strike]ter[/strike] awful,
not to see Mrs. Ramsay sitting there as she used to sit; when
really [strike]what she felt was that was all forced & put on[/strike]
on earth do we do it?
She did not feel it; she felt nothing: only
why? [strike]why? why?[/strike]
   Suddenly
Mr.
Ramsay looked at her, through the bay window.
[strike]He was thoroughly out of temper, & so[/strike] although she had finished her
coffee, she pretended to drink, in order to keep [strike]that terrible[/strike], [strike]that[/strike]
him
sinister [strike]that[/strike] man at bay. All she had heard from him this morning was
scolding —
 scolding [strike]the[/strike] Nancy, scolding James & Cam.
Old Mr. Carmichael had taken his coffee out on to the lawn —

It [strike]was[/strike] odd to be able to notice everything with extreme
accuracy, &
?When ever
anything
happened
she asked
why

life.

111
[strike]Yet to feel nothing whatever[/strike]
because it was so peaceful perhaps. [strike]But it was uncomfortable[/strike]
[strike]rather than painful[/strike] But it was not painful to her, only
extremely uncomfortable, & yet suppose that all one's life [strike]one[/strike] had
[strike]lived[/strike] in a dream, & this was true, [strike]one could not help being[/strike]
been
Lily Briscoe thought, putting her empty cup down again, as ?Mr.
Ramsay had passed on.
At any rate, she thought, looking [strike]about[/strike]
[strike]round the[/strike] at an engraving on the wall opposite, one must take one's

by the kicks & plunges of an unruly horse, with a back like a
[strike]sharp[/strike] knife board.
What is it?" she asked herself again,
[strike]as if she[/strike] with an odd feeling that she had very nearly laid hold

or almost
[strike]upon something[/strike] [strike]of the highest importance[/strike] —
 actually had grasped
?get
something — like

[strike][/strike][strike]would something[/strike] that intensity of understanding which relates
everything together: [strike]so[/strike] that it was all right —
 the misery, the
scolding —
 these eternal questions which, [strike]what[/strike] everything that
&
happened now seemed to set banging & swinging inside her.
[strike]Oh, Nancy[/strike]

[strike]& carrying on a conversation with someone inside, about its[/strike]

And what relation is that — "seeing people"?
The hideous callousness, the
entire temporariness, [strike]?oh[/strike] & the ramshackle jerrybuilt houses

Lily Briscoe, [strike]flourish[/strike] with her brush trembling slightly in her

No thing, thought Lily Briscoe; [strike]th[/strike] there she had sat, with James,

They ought not to ask all this; she ought not to have come. And at
forty four, she thought, one cannot waste weeks [strike]on[/strike] when one is 44.
For she was utterly unable to concentrate her mind on what she was
doing. [strike]No thing so annoyed her as[/strike] She held a brush; but
like this
it was irritating to hold a brush

with every appearance of genuine exaltation, & a blaze which
was certainly one of the most beautiful things on earth (she

Then he looked out to sea. Their eyes rested on the lighthouse

Never did anybody sigh as he sighed.
Without concealment, or
shyness, with the force of some primeval gust,
all he had suffered - [strike]his wif[/strike] the death of wife, of son, of
daughter - [strike]filled[/strike] seemed suddenly to fill him & to issue in
a sigh of such despondency that any woman in the whole

He had had doubts, she felt, & that was what sometimes they
talked about - Mr. & Mrs. Ramsay - till late at night, & then
Mrs. Ramsay looked tired, & then she Lily flew into a rage
with him. And now he had nobody to [strike]say[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] tell him
she suspected
that the table was there & he had found it; so that
he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, & his
face had that touch of desperation in it, of exaggeration,
which

his face had [strike]too[/strike] to crown it. [strike]an[/strike] something very simple, very

[strike]something very[/strike] suddenly, unexpectedly (as when she praised his boots,)
a zest for [strike]m[/strike]
a [strike]most[/strike] surprising recovery of sense & interest & humanity; which
passed (for he never concealed a feeling) & [strike]felt with[/strike] into that final
phase of which [strike]she had not noticed in his face before[/strike] - which
he so much [strike]moved her,[/strike] interested her, & indeed made her
[strike]su[/strike]
[strike]extre[/strike] irritated with herself for having [strike]stoo[/strike] missed her

mood, that mood which [strike]without being exalted, was[/strike] was not
exalted or remote or austere any longer but expressed
the serenity of a mind [strike]that has ceased to worry or[/strike]
which has shed its worries & its vanities, & perhaps lost its
ambitions, but is yet drawn on, as she had seen him
drawn on, at the head of that little procession to the beach,
steadily out of one's range. An extraordinary face it was to watch -

[strike]It was as[/strike] if something [strike]sn[/strike] snapped; a bramble flew back in her face;
she was stung, shocked, yet exhilarated. So roughly her
meditations were broken short. & at once, with enormous relief
she saw
[strike]she looked for the first time, at[/strike] her canvas. [strike]It was[/strike] as if it
floated up & placed itself for [strike]the first time,[/strike] white & uncompromising,

as
[strike]tr[/strike] trooped off the field; [strike]&[/strike] then, peace. She looked blankly at the
[strike]can[/strike] canvas; then at the garden. [In her hurry, she had pitched her
picture she wished to paint
easel anyhow; without considering the [strike]angle[/strike] nature of the
a picture
composition.] It was one she had attempted before - the wall, the
white washed wall,
edge of the house, the line of the [strike]head[/strike] hedge; [strike]made[/strike] [strike]For some[/strike]

which came to mind [strike]when she was[/strike] from time to time,
automatically - in [strike]London, or[/strike] the Brompton Road, or before her
looking glass, when she was pretending to comb her hair. [strike]Now,[/strike]
But there was all the difference in the world between this
involuntary making of pictures in her minds eye, & actually
laying her brush on them. Now was the disaster, the danger.
   She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation, & also
pitched her easel wrongly. She now [strike]adjusted the[/strike] fixed the little
spikes firmly & precisely into the ground; & taking her stand,

seemed too capable of bearing her along with it.

Lily stepped back & screwed up her eyes;
Committed to this particular adventure, she was now sternly set, - & was
out
becoming momentarily more & more indifferent to her own
fortunes, [strike]as a[/strike] to [strike]her own person[/strike] & arms & legs & hair & complexion
& whether it were time for this or time for that, & if she
who she was & what she was
was liked or disliked or [strike]who she was[/strike] & all the rest of it
affected one as a work of art she thought
[strike]That was perhaps an explanation[/strike]

grew dark like a cloud about to burst & one thought This is the

Mrs. Ramsay was one of them; [They say to life "Stand still there"]
was true perhaps, she thought. [strike]And[/strike] [strike]t[/strike]They say to life "Stand
[strike]still there," & they enforce[/strike] it; bringing together the wall, the sky, the

draw

[strike]An artist, a creator -[/strike]
en
[strike]Sure enough, thinking[/strike] And circling [strike]like[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] Charles Tansley again,
running over him, as she [strike]stepp[/strike] chose another brush, she
thought how it was not necessarily angular & ?sensibly
like anybody
else,
just talking,
sandy haired & repulsive, his home & his children;
but on a summer evening they would sit together on a terrace,
talking; & again he would be perfectly simple, himself, a
as on the beach, when Mrs. Ramsay did it, by looking over her
spectacles & saying "Is that a lobster pot?"
All was silence. [strike]in[/strike] Nobody even yet seemed to be stirring in the
house. [strike]It was still early of course; & perhaps they were not even up yet -[/strike]
She looked [strike]at it,[/strike] before [strike]placing her[/strike] [strike]going on, looked[/strike] at the
[strike]peaceful[/strike] house, sleeping there in the early sunlight with its
windows green & blue with the reflected leaves; &
And now indeed she was thinking of Mrs. Ramsay. She was
feeling strangely, remotely with this extreme unreality
211
155
[strike]which seemed to her so much more real than[/strike]
Not the Mrs. Ramsay of flesh & blood; but this other, [strike]the[/strike] who was remote &
hidden [strike]&[/strike] [strike]this[/strike] [strike]spirit[/strike] laugh, [strike]&[/strike] [strike]this[/strike] an essence, something gone

moulding one's thoughts. [strike]Who[/strike] It was all Mrs. Ramsay doing still -
that she thought tenderly of Charles.
Still she prevailed -
Faintly almost imperceptivly she made herself felt. She had
put off the robe of ?flesh & taken on another.
For
Lily never saw
her now. [strike]She[/strike] sometimes she thought of her.
only
The [strike]white[/strike] still house seemed in consonance with this; & the
thin smoke; & the [strike]clear[/strike] fine early morning air.
[strike]She wished to share her[/strike] [strike]Little as it was[/strike] It was unreal, it was

   For now [strike]it was[/strike] the horror was on her [strike]again[/strike]: the

But [strike]she stopped[/strike]. As if impelled by some curiosity which she must
gratify or driven by some discomfort which she must assuage,
she went a pace or two to the end of the lawn, [strike]whence she could[/strike]
to see whether down there, [strike]where[/strike] the [strike]sea spread, & one[/strike]

Down there among the little boats [strike]to[/strike] [strike]anchored[/strike] which floated
some with their sails furled, [strike]others[/strike] slowly (for it was very

[strike]with his father beside him,[/strike]
Cam curled up in the bow; & they would not say anything;
but
they would look at him, now & then, where he sat with his

His eyes sparkled. He threw his head back as if he were
down there pulling with the other men on the beach. Only his
hand as it flung itself out was, they noticed, [strike]a[/strike] so white, [strike]so[/strike] &
chiselled & shaped, compared with the brown thick mass of
Macalisters hand; & [strike]there[/strike] on his
little finger he wore a ring.
But he was thinking [strike]how they launched the life boat.[/strike]

with which he followed Macalister's story;] he liked desaster.

   Still their grievance weighed them down: they had been forced: they

was not like that.

She [strike]sought something[/strike] She wore an old shooting cap, Lily remembered.
She [strike]threw a shawl round her.[/strike] She clapped it casually on her head.
It seemed as if a lustre rested there, on the step; as if the thought of her
[strike]were[/strike] composed [strike]like a dream[/strike] itself at once into [strike]a statuesque[/strike]
shape that mourned; [strike]a grieving[/strike] he had been so beautiful; &

[strike]Her [/strike]Where was
that woman gone?
And sure enough, something swam up there on the [strike]s[/strike] drawingroom
steps: the shape of a woman, beautiful, silent with downcast eyes.
She was extremely beautiful - She [strike]said[/strike] was musing, pondering.
[strike]She was like a[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]figure of[/strike] She
[strike]about her,[/strike] But what did she mourn? Why was she grieving?
Why
[strike]What[/strike] had death given her the part to play that was none of hers

Mrs. Ramsay was always running. [strike]She had[/strike] [strike]it seemed[/strike]

[strike]Mr. Carmichael[/strike]
225
183
But what was the look she had when she clapped her deer stalkers
hat on her head, or ran across the lawn in galoshes to find slugs?
who could tell her, who could help her?
Mr. Carmichael?
   He lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch
flowing down
his beard with the yellow stain resting upon his breast. He was no
longer reading, but had the appearance of some vast brute which is now
[strike]ruminating &[/strike] has gorged itself & is now ruminating.
The
His book,
which [strike]she took to be the[/strike] [strike]had supplied he[/strike] was his [strike]?sour[/strike] source of
that
nourishment, lay fallen on the grass:
Lily had a sense of the

there

bulk, its lethargy, & his eyes their [strike]sno[/strike] smoky look, as if
the mind burnt [strike]behind a[/strike] deeply behind a [strike][?][/strike] clouded window pane.
Thus he would lie by the hour, she remembered, &
she could still see him slouching past the window, where Mrs.
Ramsay sat, furtively, [strike]?&[/strike] clumsily as if he wished
to escape
detection, but she always stopped him.
She could not
indure that anyone should [strike]feel out of things.[/strike]
feel unhappy
She tried to draw
him in. But somehow she was never successful.
She
& ?knew that anyone
resented, Lily suspected, anyone [strike]who had no need of her.[/strike]
not
should [strike]be[/strike] [strike]wld[/strike] [strike]independent[/strike] of her: that any man should: &
have no
need of her
Mr. Carmichael [strike]was the exception among men: he[/strike]
[strike]did not depend on her.[/strike] was oddly aloof: he had no needs, Lily
thought;
He shared that unpleasant peculiarity with her.
For she had no needs either.
She painted; he wrote.
But Mrs. Ramsay [strike]was[/strike] - the one who ex [strike]put[/strike]
[strike]pulled up the weeds, or[/strike] searched out slugs, (her
children said she could see a slugs egg half across the
garden) & pried with her spectacles [strike]on[/strike] into dishes,
when she was [strike]?broiling[/strike] dropping laurel or sherry;
shred by shred, drop by drop, to concoct some
[strike]amazing[/strike] triumph of cookery, [strike]wanted[/strike] [strike]so[/strike] [strike]was only[/strike]
infinitely preferred
so [strike]much preferred[/strike] life.
Could she have stood painting,
226
185
could she have lain reading a whole morning in the garden?
It was unthinkable.
She disappeared.
Without saying a word
the only token of her errand [strike]being[/strike] a basket on her arm.
She went off, to the town, to the poor, to the stuffy [strike]little[/strike] rooms, the
little
the close, the sordid
rooms, where [strike]old[/strike] suffering women,
men crushed by [strike]some[/strike] accident in the prime of life, languished,
died with the torture before them of children left or wives left;
to live There she came. And [strike]once,[/strike] Laugh who would

But
[strike]more[/strike] action & thought were not needed.
Perhaps it was Mrs.
Ramsay's beauty. Anyhow, Lily could not help it: [strike]she[/strike]
[strike]thought[/strike] followed her often going to the town with her
basket, silently: she noted her return. She thought
Eyes that are closing in pain & despair have looked on you. She
thought, [strike]your[/strike] beauty has been with them. She adored
that goodness. [strike]from the bottom of her heart.[/strike]
227

[strike]But h[/strike] But bulk & mass, the line of the house [strike]central[/strike] going so, the line of the

stared [strike]out[/strike] at her. We are your [strike]sl[/strike] masters; [strike]Your allegiance is to us,[/strike]

Mrs. Ramsay coming back, figure to herself, [strike]wonderingly,[/strike] the

how she [strike]was led to ?ca these ?journey instinctively[/strike]
the kind of
instinct within, [strike]of her,[/strike] how [strike]she was inspired to[/strike]

south; like the artichoke for the sun - Lily could find no
image for that natural instinct, [strike]which[/strike] turning her to the
[strike]sufferings &[/strike] human race, making her seek her nest in its heart.
Could she have stood painting with a woman dying[strike],[/strike]; a woman

dying. Misery prevailed Such foothold as they had won (herself &

Moreover, explain it who could, she believed that [strike]she[/strike]

[strike]final[/strike] delight of separation - that it [strike]can be[/strike] has
bodies
consciousness of mixing - [strike]the[/strike] [strike]two people[/strike] unite;
the human love has its gratification.
But that, even,
was less complete than this; for who can deny it?
Even while the arms are locked, or the sentence married in the
air with complete understanding, a cloud moves across
the sky; & i[strike]n[/strike] each lover knows, but cannot confess,
his knowledge of the transience of [strike]all[/strike] love: the
mutability of love: how tomorrow comes; [strike]how[/strike] they
?they
words other kisses.
&
[strike]But[/strike] & they are only
tossed together & nothing survives.
   But here, since the lover was the [strike]horrible[/strike]
formidable enemy - space - their union, could it be achieved,
was immortal.
No cloud moved, in that landscape; no
death came [strike]nowhere,[/strike] between them.
It was an awful
marriage; [strike]&[/strike] forever.

   And now he must do without, she supposed. Now he must suffer;
for he gave her the impression of having ?schooled himself: [strike]he[/strike]

double effect of reality & unreality due, she supposed, to
her return after all these years, so that whatever happened

[strike]It was[/strike] as [strike]if[/strike] [strike]And then, as[/strike] She thought, too, of things that had

But you will notice that there is a
note of interrogation at the end of my title.
[strike]For[/strike] It is true that
[strike]though[/strike] [strike]o[/strike]One may think about reading as much as one chooses, but it is
impossible
[strike]abominable[/strike] to lay down any sort of law about it.
Here, in this
room, we breathe the air of freedom. There are no laws, no
[strike]inequal[/strike] law givers. Each man & woman has to make up his
mind for himself.

Perhaps it is the better & more important point. To get the shock in
[?]
strongly & [strike]clearly[/strike] [strike]as possible[/strike] [strike][?] [?][/strike] as :
as [strike]much[/strike] personally as possible is perhaps the [strike]better[/strike]
the most necessary of all things. Without that private -
peculiar feeling, we [strike]cannot build or[/strike] all reading is dust & ashes.
But once received, there comes the much more curious task of
discriminating, sorting out & judging.

& left behind
she was, in this boat,
with her father & [strike]James[/strike] & the Macalisters &
James.
   The compact between them held;
the chuckling, the
rushing:
here
life formed
itself round
in the little
circle.
For this was now real: the boat; the sea; her father, & the Macalisters
& James.
[strike]Only, again,[/strike] [strike]what was[/strike] this [strike]new experience[/strike] - was
[strike]strange, this was new: this was extremely exciting.[/strike]
And in this lay the light of something so new that it is strange; &
unreal; & infinitely exciting; she looked at James.
& tyranny with
   Their compact held; to resist coercion to the death.
But
he was changed. Steering, with his eyes fixed on the sail,
frowning slightly, he looked as if he too [strike]were[/strike] [strike]had been[/strike]
[strike]were now,[/strike] & isolated, & [strike]lifted[/strike] cut off from the things they
both knew; so that they were no longer the
'children',
but
who had overslept & been scolded:
[strike]no longer[/strike]
something
had come between them & separated them & made them
strange to each other.

[strike]His[/strike]
for [strike]though[/strike] having looked at the shore
& located with his keen longsighted eyes the position of the
house, he [strike]was made to feel,[/strike] felt again come over him
a sense of some [strike]thing[/strike] wrong, some harm, some perfidy
offered him which threw him for redress upon the
sympathy of the world.
If the whole world had occupied itself
solely in weeping his sorrow? that tribute would not have been
too great. [strike]He needed[/strike]
The whole world should have been composed

coveted most [strike]fixedly[/strike] of endless inexhaustible sympathy -
sympathy in which he could bathe, to which he could return -
For who had ?perished & been more tortured than he - [strike]who[/strike]
his son, his daughter his wife all gone; ?& he left alone,
worn, aged, broken hearted - the words came
to his lips in a
curious ambling singsong; [strike]&[/strike] aged & broken
hearted, he would
murmur, & feel
nothing but the exquisite delight of the sympathy
which the world he was imagining would give him -
so
that sometimes [strike]in a queer dramas[/strike] minutes
fled in these queer
dramas in
which he beheld himself,
[strike]the stake[/strike] like the
lonely stake, the beaten poll
(& here he looked at his hands
which were lean enough
to
confirm the dream) & then
[strike]again[/strike] beheld the divine faces of comforters looking up at him
& offering him the solace of innumerable sighs; imploring
him to tell them what he suffered; [strike]& then[/strike] which he would
recite, in words
which
& get again
the divine [strike]im[/strike] relief of
succeeding each other

[strike]spoken together;[/strike]
& [strike]so this[/strike]
this would go on [strike]until, a[/strike] repeated & repeated, &, failing &
being renewed, until it would seem to him suddenly
?he

in which he could be the actor, &
?who

[strike]stop.[/strike] stopped.
   [strike]Was ?there[/strike] [strike]Cam: James.[/strike] old Macalister. The Lighthouse.
   Look at the house! he repeated.
And now James turned his head to look over his shoulder
201
as his father bade him.
   For now again, woken from this drama of the lean form crucified,
& the women endlessly pitying, he must make them - the children -
happy; friendly; must see that they grow up admiring, loving,
courageous; must fortify them with memories implant in them
some help against the battle [strike]of life[/strike] before them.
Had
Cam looked?
   He [strike]asked her[/strike] waved his hand so that they should
both look; & [strike]began telling them both[/strike] how
   But Cam could not see the house. She was shortsighted,
like her mother. She could see nothing clearly.
And [strike]this[/strike]
since he had the long steady gaze of a leader, of an explorer,
used to judging distances & keeping landmarks in view,
[strike]this[/strike]
he could see
clearly, ?everything;

   There was the house, he said.

he made her look along, leaning against them.

But James knew Cam would never be able to see [strike]anything[/strike] at

it annoyed him that she could not;

[strike]show[/strike] either that she knew or that she cared.] Her bright

his hand, & [strike]faced the problem[/strike]
[strike]which[/strike] what should he say to her?
How should [strike]he approach her?[/strike]
How should he control [strike]this[/strike] his hand &
his voice & his ?face, & all the obedient [strike]?now[/strike] quickly [strike]forming[/strike]

these seventy years now? [strike]How should he dodge that[/strike]

[strike]way of truth. They judged him.[/strike]

They judged him:
was humiliating
[strike]But[/strike] he was old, worn, tired: true[strike],[/strike].
Ah, he would not gesticulate. He would [strike]find something to say.,[/strike]
   [strike]How[/strike] was the puppy unhappy, left alone. "Who was going
to take it out today?" he asked her. & James
thought pitilessly, now she will give way. Now

I shall be left alone to carry out [strike]my[/strike] the vow - [strike]which was to[/strike]
He had sworn it in the garden when he was a child: to resist
206
205
tyranny to the death.
Decked in a thousand brilliant colours,
this vice came among men. [They were affective; & they conquered]
People always went under to [strike]them:[/strike] the tyrants; women [strike]did[/strike] in
particular; [strike]but the loathsome vice always showed through[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]it all. He might charm, he might preach; he might be[/strike]
[strike]a great man for anything James knew;[/strike]
They charmed. They wheedled.
Now he was wheedling Cam, about
this puppy; & she would give way; & the compact would be left to him
carry out. to resist tyranny to the death.
[strike]But she did not answer.[/strike]
upon
Sometimes [strike]a[/strike] [strike]over[/strike] a hill that has been green & bright &
sunny, a cloud falls; gravity descends; there, among all
the miles of surrounding brightness, alone is gloom &

sadness; for a moment, for a space.
So [strike]now[/strike] & if one can
fancy thought among hills & high places,
it would seem as
if they must ponder the fate of the clouded & darkened;
so
Cam was [strike]sudd[/strike] overcast now, with the cloud that rested on her,
of the whole burden & battle & ?desaster of life; & how
impossible of solution; & how her father's voice asking who
was to take the puppy out, [strike]was[/strike] cleft her, [strike]for she[/strike]

abandoned, the criminals, who when the gates shut on
them, repent their crime, & beg forgiveness; [strike]but there[/strike] is
[strike]always[/strike] a lawgiver, stern & just, [strike]who[/strike] forbids forgiveness, &
[strike]rightly[/strike] too; a lawgiver who has somehow laid open
upon his knees the tablets of eternal wisdom;

& rightly
of all human qualities she revered justice most, she
thought;
her brother was most godlike;
only an
existence like this, she thought, still gazing
at the
shore, whose points were unknown to her, with one will

[strike]impressions of sights & sounds, of scents, & wh voices, of dresses[/strike]
[strike]rustling, of bracelets tinkling, & the white underside of leaves, of the[/strike]
[strike]wash & hush of the waves -[/strike] [strike]all of which had he done their[/strike]
[strike]part in making them as[/strike] how should he single out from all this,
[strike]& the[/strike] impressions which had fallen on him, [strike]on h[/strike] & on her too,

Well, if Cam would not speak to him, he would bother her, [strike]no more,[/strike]
thought Mr. Ramsay.
But she would speak to him, if she could think of anything, firm &
fierce, & disinterested, loyal to the compact, yet just to [strike]the[/strike] his
demand he made; & yet his integrity, his truthfulness - for, she
thought, looking stealthily at her brother, who kept his eyes
dispassionately on a certain spot in the [strike]?su[/strike] curve of the sail,
now, & then looked aside at the grey [strike]tower[/strike] of the lighthouse,
[strike]you're are free;[/strike] [strike]from his[/strike] you're not exposed [strike]to a pressure which[/strike]
[strike]she felt[/strike] it - to this curious pressure, she meant this

no one
attracted her more than this strange old man. His hands were beautiful; &
his [strike]strong,[/strike] shapely feet. His voice was beautiful, & his words. [strike]He[/strike]
Above all, his haste & his fervour; his oddity; his ridiculousness; his
extreme
burning energy; & his remoteness; [strike]& his[/strike] But what remained
he was
beautiful; he
was e
intolerable, & would forever indicate as with the sudden[strike]l[/strike][strike]y[/strike]

enough to quell the stormiest passion of her heart,

demand upon her, upon James, upon the whole world perhaps; Submit to me.
So she would not say.
210
213
[strike]Give me what I want, because my need is so enormous; that was[/strike]
[strike]his demand. But his need was not greater than other peoples. Her's[/strike]
[strike]even[/strike]

   Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, watching the boat
with the brown sails flatten itself upon the water & [strike]pass[/strike]

were they
the children against their will; but why so savage she asked
herself turning back to her easel?
For [strike]her[/strike] the sympathy
It was always the same.
She had never been able,
she had not given him weighed on her.
[strike]all the years she h[/strike] when she stayed there, to praise him.
She had always left that to people like Minta Doyle.
That was a
pity perhaps.
It reduced their relationship to something
neutral, without that element of sex which had made his
manner to Minta Doyle so gallant, almost gay.
He
would pick a flower for her; she borrowed his books.
But
how could Minta read them?
She dragged them about
the garden, sticking in leaves to mark her place.
   Heaven be praised for it, she thought; taking up her brush again.
[strike]There was[/strike] The problem of space faced her. She had made, with

215
[strike]carv[/strike] [strike]cut[/strike] [strike]outlined[/strike]
Her flickering brown line
had left ?on in the middle of her
canvas a shape,
a solid, shapeless, mass; an iceberg; looming, imminent
prominent [strike]right[/strike] unrelated, right there in the middle of the canvas.
[strike]How[/strike] It was to be
seized upon & animated, & given its due weight
touching it at once
supporting it -
depending on
it
& poise, somehow;
[strike]made to live[/strike]
there, in the centre, with all the other
weights & colours somehow depending on it - [strike]she saw her picture[/strike]
[strike]like a cathedral,[/strike] [strike]whose walls:[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] [strike]were all[/strike] [strike]all held together with[/strike]

perfectly
[strike]shoring it[/strike] up, until the whole structure, [strike]became[/strike] beautifully poised,

for all its [strike]in[/strike] weight, [strike]had a[/strike] [strike]glowed &[/strike] [strike]light[/strike] Beautiful & bright

?haze
looked as if a breath would [strike]blow[/strike] ruffle the [strike]int[/strike] [strike]colours[/strike] yellows & golds & blues
it was to be clamped together with bolts of iron.
Directly
she took her
brush in
her hand
The little ?pleasures & comforts & anxieties of the real world fell from her.
[strike]Here success was not personal, nor fleeting:[/strike] all was done in solitude
with effort & [strike]here directly she took her brush in her hand.[/strike] she
felt face & ?colour & limbs fall from her, shrivelled up; she
[strike]Verly[/strike] Very likely she would be scorched alive, & nothing left of her -
that was her feeling. It was an awful effort & risk; &
[strike]& all the[/strike] no one to know either, if she failed, or survived: judges
there were none; yet, inevitably, she herself would read her
fate, much more clearly here ?than; would measure herself
against a rule whose wishes were marked indelibly.
So, with her brush laden she began
to read the precarious
maze, the dance of line & colour, which, as it went daringly
sensitively [strike]with acute[/strike]
over the canvas, call up more
intensely than at other times

Nancy saying "What does one send to the Lighthouse?"; the greenish
light on the engraving; the children laughing down the path; Mr.
Ramsay sending Cam back for her cloak: his hand raised as he
passed her - all this seemed [strike]she thought not like the natural[/strike]
[strike]process of living, but symbolical of life. So that had she been able to[/strike]

[strike]seemed to start up like[/strike]

She sat on the beach writing one of those innumerable letters, which
the wind sometimes blew away across the sand.
'There was the old

a wave breaking, racing almost up to the rock where Mrs. Ramsay
sat, writing, writing, in that little round rapid hand that was so illegible.

Probably not. She was glad, Lily thought, to rest in silence,

behind Minta who had a hole in her stocking. Now [strike]his eyes[/strike]
itself
[strike]kept[/strike] it seemed to flaunt before them - how he deplored it - without,

detested;

It meant
[strike]ruin[/strike]
dirt disorder; a home with
servants leaving [strike]&[/strike] beds not made at midday - [strike]all things that[/strike]
bills, [strike]perhaps,[/strike] unpaid - all things he abhorred.
[strike]As[/strike]
Perhaps it [strike]was true.[/strike]
[strike]In fact,[/strike]
[strike]she believed,[/strike] [strike]the marriage had been at first quite[/strike] There was some
of the stocking
truth in that vision on the sandy path going up from the
beach all those years ago - [strike]The marriage[/strike] at first had been
successful [strike]at[/strike] first.
There were two little boys.
Then things worked
loose - They came home at [strike]such[/strike] different hours, from different places.
Lily imagined them meeting on the stairs - Minta garish,
wreathed & tinted, about three o'clock in the morning.
[strike]To[/strike]
[strike]finish the picture[/strike] Paul carrying a poker, in case of burglars,
Minta eating a sandwich, in the cadaverous early morning
light on a staircase with holes in the carpet, dusty [strike]she[/strike] [strike]?worn[/strike] littered.
What did they say? Something violent. He was withered,
drawn; she was flamboyant careless.
She ate her sandwich
while he spoke - in a mutter, so as not to wake the children.
That was the sort of thing had happened, she supposed, painting;
This is what we call 'knowing' people, she thought.
This is what we
call

   [strike]Then again:[/strike] Another incident [strike]struck her,[/strike] came to mind - Paul
saying that he "played chess in coffee houses".
She always
remembered it. [strike]For[/strike] He wandered off: he was solitary. It is

He should have sat at home after dinner, reading his books; should have
been domestic; His perfect [strike]nose[/strike] profile hardened & stiffened; for he
played chess in coffee houses; & then came home; [strike]& then[/strike] [strike]there was th[/strike]

object to his showing her, for example the cucumber frame, or the
Belgian
place where he bred hares, in case he should say anything:
She
came after them, singing & put her bare arm round his shoulder;
but she was bored by hares.
   Lately though ([strike]so she[/strike] here was another scene) they were doing
something with a motor car: & from his manner & hers, Lily knew,
then again
with the
children
as if they had told her everything, & both were reticent, that
[strike]something had happened[/strike]. It was all right now. They had entered on
another phase.

in a
coffee house - had met somebody utterly [strike]different[/strike] - a

[strike]al[/strike]
& all her beauty, all her being, became at once a little [strike]pointless[/strike]
dusty old fashioned.
What can be done for them, then, she?
For a moment she exulted.
Who persisted so obstinately - one could never, even in thought, wrench her
round, in saying

(Suddenly, suffused with reddish light, she saw again

down by Mrs. Ramsay at dinner.

a haze of

At the same time, [strike]even in the height of the[/strike] roar & the

Mr. Carmichael [strike]?[/strike]
He lay on his chair with his hands clasped
above his paunch, his beard with the yellow stain on it
flowing upon his breast.
He was no longer reading.
He was
gorged & ruminating.
His book had fallen on the grass.
It lay there, giving off a fume of words, of poetry; he seemed
[strike]to lie there breathing in the incense, torpid, half asleep.[/strike]
& he seemed drugged, drowsy.
221
235
She wanted to go straight up to him & say
   "Mr. Carmichael!"
   Then he would look up benevolently. "About Mrs. Ramsay -
about life - about death - about everything in the whole world!
But you couldn't say that to Mr. Carmichael.
You could
say nothing to anybody.

missed its mark.

Words fluttered sideways & struck the object inches too low.
Then one
gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became, like

She looked at the drawing room steps, [strike]empty,[/strike] They were empty.
It
[strike]That[/strike] came over her [strike]violent[/strike] powerfully, for the first time.

[strike]It was extremely unpleasant.[/strike] [strike]it[/strike] Like all strong feelings, the

[strike]Why had she come all[/strike]
[strike]this way, to be made[/strike] why should she have done it?
Ghost, air,
nothingness - [strike]for months Lily went without thinking of her now.[/strike]
[strike]Now[/strike]
[strike]it seemed as if Mrs. Ramsay[/strike]
[strike]had one only been letting one run a[/strike]
[strike]little to suit her own purposes.[/strike]
She wanted one back.
One came back.
She was only that.
Suddenly [strike]she became the only desirable pe thing[/strike] in life
Then suddenly she asserted herself again, & the empty drawing room steps
& the frill moving & the puppy tumbling on the
terrace
all seemed to

like hollow phantoms ?curvetting, spouting, [strike]round[/strike] a [strike]terrible[/strike]

round complete emptiness.
222
237
well
then
[strike]What is your[/strike] [strike]opinion of life on the whole[/strike], Mr. Carmichael?" she would
trying to

say; so she thought look[strike]ing[/strike] at her canvas.
She was actually crying - that is
to say [strike]tears[/strike] both her eyes were full of some
[strike]rath[/strike] hot liquid
which without
disturbing the firmness of her lips, rolled down her cheeks.
But she had
perfect control of herself in every other way.
[strike]But, most[/strike]
[strike]ridiculously &[/strike]
[strike]annoyingly it was impossible for the moment to paint.[/strike]

Why did [strike]they[/strike] acquiesce in [strike]this monstrous state of things[/strike]?
Why don't we do something about it?
Are we fish, [strike]are we[/strike] coal? - are
or
we things that can be packed in barrels & ?rattled/?salted/?sailed across the world
without protest?
She had a wild idea that if she & Mr.
Carmichael [strike]toget[/strike] got up & made some violent display,
the hollow space which the step & the chair & the puppy indicated
would be vanquished.
If they shouted loud enough, Mrs.
Ramsay would come back.
   It was a degrading state to be in, no doubt. [strike]Of[/strike] All extreme states were
that. Of the pain of childbirth a woman had told her that it was
demoralising. No. So this was demoralising - to wish for
anyone so strongly that one's only notion was to stand up &
shout. Stop pain, stop pain, stop pain!
[strike]And[/strike] It was not
meanwhile
love [strike]either;[/strike] for her feeling towards Mrs. Ramsay was [strike]almost[/strike]
[strike]hatred[/strike] - bitter - it
   [strike]Only at last,[/strike] one [strike]can so f[/strike] could so separate into parts this
this bitterness of wanting & this resentment of being made
to want (just as
she was painting too, & marvelling that she did not care a
straw for Mrs. Ramsay being dead) & [strike]half that yes[/strike] partly - yes
it dawned upon her that her feeling was already finding an anditode
(as they used to say dock leaves grew beside nettles) in a a
but later
embracing the
whole character
& being &
world,
a sense, first purely physical, but very lively, of the
of
whole [strike]beauty of that[/strike] [strike]Mrs. Ramsays[/strike]
&
beauty,
[strike]of[/strike] her serenity, of
the majesty with which
taking her
way among the dead she
had raised & fitted to her
forehead [strike]a[/strike] white flowers in a
crown.
   She had never heard how she had died: only 'suddenly'.
But
223
239
[strike]she had[/strike] but for days afterwards she had seen her, from some
trick of a painters eye perhaps, raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers,
& stepping with her usual quickness [strike]am[/strike] across the fields, among
whose folds, for they were distant & the flowers very dim, she had
vanished. Now Prue & Andrew went with her.
[strike][?][/strike]
Inevitably
wherever she happened to be, were it
London or country,
her eye
then, [strike]clos[/strike] half closing sought in the real world some
counterpart, something to help out her imagination; & found it in

within her mind.
[strike]Thus[/strike] [strike]Now it was the thought of[/strike] Mr.
Ramsay, recalled by a boat.
She thought, that is their boat,
I [strike]suppose.[/strike] It is now in the middle of the bay. They had been gone an
hour & a half.
And again - the weight of her sympathy made
her try to call up the seats & the coil of rope, Cams skirt, James'
tie, Mr. Ramsays beautiful boots.
224
241
No one had seen her [strike]surrender,[/strike] step off her firm strip of board into the
bitter waters which are there, threatening annihilation.
And now slowly the [strike]pan[/strike] pain & the anger [strike]of wanting, of[/strike]
to be recalled
[strike]slack[/strike] [strike]lessened,[/strike] (just as she was pluming her self upon having escaped

   She stepped with her usual quickness across fields among whose

she [strike]had[/strike] vanished.
It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days

after she had heard of her death, Lily had seen her thus, [strike]stepping,[/strike] with

Whereever she happened to be, if it were in London, or in the country,
her eyes, half closing, sought [strike]in the real world[/strike] something to
base her vision on, she looked down the [strike]lane of the[/strike] railway carriage,
at the windows opposite, if it were London; or in the country, at the
curve of the road, at the mass of the hill.

in one way. [strike]There[/strike] Something forced itself on her which she could not

It was a boat.
It was their
boat. It was half across the bay now.
In it sat Mr.
Ramsay, to whom she had refused her sympathy: & he had
beautiful boots, wonderful boots.

The boat with the brown sails was now half way across the bay.
So fine was the morning [strike]that[/strike] except for a streak of wind here & there, the

the sea & sky looked
[strike]as if they met without any[/strike]

It was awfully monotonous, & very hot too, [strike]so[/strike] [strike]fl[/strike] flapping about, waiting for a
breeze, miles from shore, & miles from the [strike]Lig[/strike] lighthouse[strike],[/strike]. Sometimes [strike]for[/strike]
the sails sagged [strike]alt[/strike] entirely, & [strike]at once[/strike] you could hear [strike]the waves[/strike]
little waves, though they were right out to sea, [strike]brea[/strike] lapping against the boat; &

Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still The sun beat down.
The boat became full  of squeaks & creaks. Macalister's fishing line
went
The lighthouse
stood still, & the
hills on [strike]the[/strike]
in the distance
plumb down into the sea. & everybody
seemed very close together &
there came a
[?] ?dark
line up
the sea
[strike]quite indifferent to each other,[/strike]
terribly depressed.
Then, almost before the
sail filled, the boat would seem to [strike]be[/strike]
make an effort, [strike]to[/strike]
as if
she were bracing herself together, & sure enough,
almost before
the moment after
she
[strike]would stretch herself out & lie,[/strike] creak & groan & begin to move,
half consciously, as if in her sleep, [strike]acr[/strike] through the water.
The
fishing lines (Cam held one too) would pull her aslant again,
&
the far away hills & the lighthouse would begin bobbing up & down
[strike]again[/strike] as before.
[strike]But nobody had[/strike]
[strike]Everyone[/strike] They all felt much
happier,
but
[strike]nobody said anything.[/strike]
[strike]again,[/strike] [strike]it was ever so long since anybody had spoken.[/strike]
   Suppose that anybody had spoken, half an hour ago, James would have
[strike]almost certainly[/strike] have felt as if a little stick, something finicky &
obtrusive, had been stuck into a stream which was running full tilt
at top speed all one way.
[strike]But nobody had spoken.[/strike]
His father, who was
reading, had turned [strike]the[/strike] a page.
[strike]one[/strike] two or three
That was enough
to give
the
stream a vicious curve.
For it was all about his father; the
or rather,
for
his father [strike]having ceased[/strike] [strike]had long[/strike] [strike]physically had long ceased[/strike]
[strike]to[/strike]
[strike]influence his thought, it was[/strike]
[strike][strike]about his[/strike][/strike]
[strike]&[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]the[/strike]
& when his father turned a page, it seemed
[strike]a very[/strike] sharp as if he turned it
self assertive [strike]way of turning a page,[/strike] an insolent, or insolently,
or
with a desire to ?interfere; or with his usual love of
making himself [strike]conspicuou[/strike] out an object of pity.
Had he, [strike]as well[/strike]
in addition to turning
a
page spoken [strike][?][/strike], surely at last something
would have happened.
He
[strike]James[/strike] always had at the back of his mind
an idea of a dagger which he would plunge into his father's heart.
[strike]But this was half an hour ago.[/strike]
He had always
16
10
[u]7[/u]
£35
NYPL
227
247
He had always had that idea of [strike]plunging something[/strike] [strike]?at[/strike] striking his father,
killing something violently.
Powerless as he was, to strike, to kill was his only
means of [strike]defying tyranny[/strike]
breaking a [strike]hole in the suffocating[/strike]
[strike]barricade[/strike] his way out to the freedom. [strike]Yet[/strike] That there was something
irrational in this [strike]recourse,[/strike] [strike]violent desire, he[/strike] terror, in this demand, he
knew now. He knew now, even at this moment, when he sat with
his hand on the tiller, looking fiercely at his father, [strike]who[/strike] [strike]did nothing[/strike]
[strike]sat absorbed in his book,[/strike]
that the thing he [strike]would kill was[/strike]
wanted to kill was not that man [strike]there[/strike],
the old distinguished man

[strike]but[/strike] who was - strangely -
completely ignorant of any [strike]such[/strike] vice on his part, or any anger on his
son's part. [strike]?H[/strike] It was a thing that descended on him: an [strike]aug[/strike] [strike]?august devil,[/strike] if
[strike]that[/strike] [strike]of[/strike] without his knowing it. A thing that had always descended on
him; that had perched on his shoulders & pecked at them all
when they were children. [strike]His fear was[/strike] And now that he was growing up,
there were times when he could see [strike]himself[/strike] his father [strike]like a ?good[/strike]
like a man haunted by a devil,
But
[strike]He knew[/strike] now that the man himself,
was
who walked about, quite unconscious of it, burdened with this vulture [strike]of[/strike]
[strike]was not[/strike] a thing that descended on him without his knowledge. He was
There was [strike]n[/strike] something consoling in the thought.
His vices were not
himself,

And [strike]wh[/strike] at the same time that he felt this,
The vulture might fly off. might leave him
[strike]There was[/strike] And then they were bound
But [strike]none the less[/strike] when he grew up
he meant to go for it; meant to track it down wherever he found it.
It was a terrible vice - making people do things when they did not
want to do them - interfering with free speech - for how could they say,
I don't want to do this? No one dared say that. [strike]Yet if t[/strike] The
great black vulture whom he felt as a little boy pecking at his
bare legs would have clouted them over the [strike]wings[/strike] head with his
wings.
No doubt his fright was irrational.
He was a
gentle old man, very simple, very austere.
Anyone could speak to him.
Look at him reading there.
Anybody would say, he has no such
thought in his mind.
But, James replied, [strike]as he was[/strike] swept
along by this hot current,
if he says do that, one had to do it
[strike]nobody who[/strike] once feel that tyranny
& you [strike]can[/strike] never forget it.
For he tried to [strike]exc[/strike] make excuses, as he
228
249
steered for the [strike]violence of his own[/strike] feelings - [strike]why, when[/strike]
this. As he grew older he made a very queer kind of excuse. [strike]He said[/strike]
& this he felt more & more, [strike]it is not him I hate, but[/strike] [strike]how he[/strike] for
he was more & more like that sin-haunted man, that man with the
vulture on his shoulder; he
was
like him in all save that: in
bareness & austerity
[strike]&[/strike] in some fanatical quality, in some
[strike]def[/strike] [strike]?giv[/strike] intolerance, & insight: [[strike]he[/strike] only
no vulture should be
allowed to perch on him.]
Further, & this puzzled
him
more & more,

Often, he felt, no two people in the world had
There were only

space:

& his
fathers.
set foot precisely there, where he came, & his father came, together.
But further, & this ?turned his clearness, puzzled him always a little,
&
[strike]what[/strike] he hated that man not for what he had done this morning, or last
week, but for some curious terror which he had suffered at his hands
years & years ago. Suppose that as a child his perambulator had
been stood in a field where there was a bull; [strike]for ever after[/strike]
[strike]suppose[/strike] no but that was not quite it. Suppose as a child
he had seen a waggon crush a childs foot - [strike]for ever after one would[/strike]
go in [strike]fear of waggons, & crushing:[/strike]
that was more like it.
A man
waggon
who crushed peoples feet, yet
never knew [strike]it. A[/strike] that he was doing it, &
himself sitting [strike]lit[/strike] helpless
in a perambulator watching - that was
a little
[strike]something[/strike] nearer the
[strike]explan[/strike] nature of his anger & terror & the sense
of helplessness that overcame him, even now, when his father came
striding along the passage, knocking them up, early in the morning, to go to
the Lighthouse.
   But whose foot did he crush? [strike]Where was[/strike] that
[strike]waggon[/strike] going What field? What truth was there in [strike]all[/strike] at
the back of all this? There was [strike]that[/strike] - & here there came before
[strike]him[/strike]
There was that garden.
[strike]A[/strike] that miraculous garden, where
[strike]everything[/strike] [strike]to begin with[/strike] where before the [strike]f[/strike] fall of the world (&
he did really divide time into the space before catastrophe, & the
space after) [strike]all the[/strike] if it was not actual fine weather, at any rate
nobody was gloomy like this: where there were ever so many
people in & out all day long; where there was no dont & do, but
simply commonsense prevailing, & freedom. where - how; he did not know,
all the colours were [strike]of a kind[/strike] of deep, glowing kind: blue bowls; jars of
great burning red - all in confusion, yet order: windows open, blinds
229
251
flapping & in those days yellow awnings had to be spread over the doors to
prevent the paint blistering: bowls held [strike]b[/strike] gold fish: [strike]an air[/strike] through the
warm summer air voices eagerly talking could be heard: shouts of
laughter: [strike]&[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] & then, when night came,
it was
like a very thin veil
drawn over the [strike]light of the sun, still like more very soothinly[/strike]
the [strike]windows[/strike] daylight: it hushed & soothed; [strike]peopl[/strike] it covered
up what
would be glowing there the day after.
   [strike]But[/strike] But the waggon wheel must have gone over a foot there; even then:
Presumably if he were quite honest, he meant his mother.
A waggon that goes over a foot without its being anbodies fault, yet, if you see it done,
sitting up in your perambulator, helpless, [strike]the[/strike] it is [strike]exc[/strike] [strike]pain[/strike] torture:
it is excruciating pain: [strike]Very well. He was now matching it[/strike]
It went over her once or twice.

[strike]opening & shutting[/strike]. There it was, noiselessly opening & shutting
it
with the light of the lighthouse coming through, silently, [strike]steadily all night[/strike] long.
[strike]It had been to him a symbol.[/strike] opening its eye, [strike]of[/strike] shutting it, [strike]in time[/strike] [strike]until,[/strike] in a kind of
   [strike]Unfortunately,[/strike]
rhythm, until listening, seeing, the waves, the light, one
[strike]fell asleep.[/strike] [strike]nu[/strike] one fell asleep, but so lightly that all the time one heard

a stark grey funnel on a rock, something like an extinguisher: [strike]there it was[/strike]

[strike]There was a gulf of some sort between[/strike]
[strike]the world before the[/strike]

It was impossible to make the two things

[strike]It became more & more difficult[/strike]
   [strike][/strike][strike]Even there, thinking about the world before the catastrophe, he would[/strike]
[strike]almost forget why he had begun to think of it.[/strike]
[strike]Or, something so ?cut ?as[/strike]

[strike]discrepancy[/strike] [strike]between the two[/strike] & it had come to him through his father - even

For it rained of course if he said so; but what was [strike]w[/strike] worse,
what was lasting,
was this [strike]lasting[/strike] turn he gave to the
whole nature of things, ?setting
so that for ever after they showed the

The Lighthouse had turned grey & stark.
And this being the [strike]noble[/strike]
was ?founded
on colour; &
nature of truth, it was not to be gainsaid.
The world before the rain
was founded on queer things which one could never seize again.
It [strike]was[/strike] Yet those things [strike]p[/strike] kept ringing, [strike]suddenly[/strike] chiming. Confusion
seemed inevitable: clash, conflict. [strike]Always in[/strike] They would be sitting
And if it [strike]was the[/strike]
What he [strike]pointed out to[/strike]
[strike]And if [?][/strike]
But still
that by no means exhausted what was in his mind about this
wheel going over a persons foot.
When he said "a person" it was
always a sign to himself that he was drawing near that [strike]cur[/strike]
[strike]extraordinary[/strike] that awful ?bore, that thing he never wanted to think about
really, since it was devastating & unnerving & [strike][?][/strike] terrible, terrible
to think of her - his mother, he meant; but sheered off as quick as he could,
[strike]calling her[/strike] refusing to visualise her as clearly as, unfortunately, he was able.
For she could be seen again, unfortunately, by going into certain
little things wh he

rooms, taking hold of certain little [strike]box la[/strike] painted boxes [strike]which[/strike] ?or

sometimes
when Rose talked, in her way,
coming down on [u]this[/u] word, on [u]that[/u]
word; & ending a laugh, with three 'ahs' which always seemed to
[strike]express the essence of joy, like a birds[/strike] last drops of some
of ?people
[strike]ex[/strike] perfect ?happiness wrung out one by one like that - ah, ah, ah.
Now somehow that wheel [strike]had[/strike] ([strike]&[/strike] he looked so ferociously at his
father reading, hunched up, in the middle of the boat: Cam, [strike]first[/strike]

She
There he was

[strike]quite[/strike] certain that she felt the same horror that [strike]they did, that[/strike]
he & Cam did.
[strike]There was that horrible[/strike] It was some horror
that afflicted them all in the same way: ugliness: noise; violence: but
truth.
And then, when he would have plunged a dagger in his
father's heart, she seemed, after sitting puzzled, for a few minutes, to
have made up her mind.
She [strike]would[/strike] snubbed him fearfully once.
233
257
But his mother somehow got up & went away into the distance, leaving him,
ridiculously;
grasping a paper knife,
impotently
[strike]impotent to do anything[/strike]
& [strike]he could not[/strike]
[strike]follow her, even now[/strike]
where she went & what she felt he could not, even now,

majestically into the distance

She [strike]became suddenly[/strike] remote, & majestic;

   Not a breath of wind blew. The boat [strike]was like a very lazy old[/strike]
[strike]animal, stretching,[/strike]
stretched itself for a moment & then relaxed
?alert,
?alone,
slackened. [strike]James felt that his father[/strike] At any moment Mr. Ramsay
might wake up in a [strike]state[/strike] of [strike]great[/strike] [strike]an[/strike] annoyance; &
ed,
a thought which made James think all the more intently &
rigidly [strike]w[/strike] about his mother, as though he were stealing down stairs
in bare feet, afraid of waking a watchdog, with a creaking board.
[strike]what happened when she left him, why she had done it, & what she was like;[/strike]
What was she like then?
[strike]He knew now that the[/strike]
There was that phantom; [strike]but[/strike] whose approach was all set about with
anguish & tears; so that, speaking soberly one must shut that [strike]off,[/strike]
[strike]if one wanted to[/strike] all off, [strike]fo[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] he wished to be very exact. [ When she
[strike]went away,[/strike] why then [strike]sh[/strike] did she marry him?
If they were alone,
what did they talk about? ] He wanted to follow her from room to room,
as she went about unsuspectingly, & at last to find himself alone with her:
& then to put to her question after question. He wanted to
all that

& [?]
in the
garden
[strike]master[/strike] encircle & master [strike]the[/strike] this extraordinary, miraculous
garden: where he kept finding himself, [strike]which kept coming back[/strike] rather
unwittingly.
[strike]yet so seductively[/strike]
[strike]What, then, if she were there now,[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]would one feel?[/strike]
[strike]And could one speak to her?[/strike]
[strike]But what could one say, having followed her into some little private room?[/strike]
[strike]At last, one would be able to speak the truth;[/strike]
to speak the truth at last; to have done with these intolerable
evasions. these lies, these subterfuges.
[strike]Nobody[/strike] [strike]Someb[/strike]
He could never be told the truth
The truth was [strike]the[/strike] simplest of all
things.
It might be very unpleasant.
[strike]"Yes, but your books are not[/strike]
[strike]first rate. You are not a great philosopher."[/strike]
[strike]Also it was[/strike]
[strike]amusing. Old Carmichael was, really, a figure of fun.[/strike]
Also
very amusing; very easy, very satisfying.
To her alone,
one could say it that was the source of her everlasting attraction for him -
234
249 
why she had remained all these years, in the background there,
like the answer to some question, which nagged at one.
What was the
use now of asking it? He thought how they lived surrounded by
mists & vapours. All the figures of their landscape were bulging or
dwindling like figures in a crazy looking glass at a fair.
Ask a simple question, But why did she marry him? why, if
his books were bad, could she not say so? & then, these
distorted figures (he had in mind Professors & old women)

that way, until to blunder into the drawing room of a
Sunday afternoon was to feel [strike]ashamed,[/strike]
an insult to them all; to them both; for he had that fibre in him too:
And all this, whatever they might say of her beauty & her goodness,
she would not have tolerated for an instant.
235
251
And [strike]he[/strike] the house grew steadily darker, with things that could not be thrown away.
[strike]Little shrines seemed to[/strike]
& there were shrines [strike]?on[/strike] in corners where
sacred objects accumulated, in ?& with their associations thick upon them,
Then there were lectures;
nights of early dinners, & long
dreary drives in the heart of winter to tabernacles in the
city where his father, standing up very stiff & straight, proved

James tried to imagine his mother
in a chill

hall
he could only see her:
there: she [strike]would[/strike] have twitched
her cloak round her, feeling the cold.
But she was dead by that time.

Even when his
audiences [strike]had[/strike] did not half fill the hall, & were mostly elderly
women, whose heads rose & fell, like hens sipping, as they listened, &
wrote, & then listened & wrote, still he [strike]p[/strike] lectured. He liked [strike]one[/strike] of his

children to go with him.
They had to say something in the cab going

But they had none of them anything

But that
did not satisfy him & the evening ended in an [strike]mort[/strike]

& [strike]the[/strike] he felt it more & more as the audiences grew smaller,
& the war went on, & there seemed no good in anything,
[strike]a[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] a respect for his father doggedly sticking it out about God &
morals.
Nobody could possibly deny that he had an
236
253
a brai
an extraordinary mind. He found Jasper reading one of his books
& they argued [strike]about[/strike] what it was all about.
But as his father treated him [strike]always[/strike] as if he were a bumpkin & a
any interest
whatever in
it.
booby he was not going to let on that he had [strike]any sort of[/strike] [strike]interest in it.[/strike]
And [strike]the type of creature who came about -[/strike]
the atheists, the socialists, the
The [strike]pacifist the conscientious objector was[/strike]

Besides they were detestable - the people [strike]he liked[/strike] - the atheists the
socialists, the pacifists.
There was a creature they [strike]once[/strike] had
to stay with them, called Charles Tansley.
237
255
Sitting perfectly still in the sun, with the boat rocking, fearing every moment
that his father would look up, he was powerless to flick off [strike]these thoug[/strike]
[strike]this[/strike] these grains of misery: settling on his mind one after another.
[strike]And the sense of coercion would increase:[/strike] a band seemed to tie [strike]to[/strike] him there,
& his father had knotted it, & he could only escape by taking a knife &
plunging it - [strike]Cam, he thought,[/strike] At that very moment, [strike]the boat[/strike]
[strike]shivered,[/strike] & the sail [strike][?][/strike] swung round & filled, & the boat [strike]seemed[/strike]
[strike]to[/strike] pulled herself together, & [strike]to creak & groan,[/strike] & to move [strike]off[/strike] off
half consciously, as if in her sleep,
through the water. & then lay on her side & shot off
[strike]Half[/strike] His father, without [strike]waking, raised[/strike] being quite aware of what was

& Cam [strike]thought[/strike] said to herself
[strike]wel[/strike]
"in deeper gulfs than thee",
as if she

something
were [strike]adding up[/strike] an importunate, [strike]sum,[/strike] [strike]pull[/strike] adding it up, ending it.
over to herself
Sitting upright, [strike]instead of drooping,[/strike] she said the whole poem as far as she
knew it
   [strike]We perished each alone,[/strike]
   But I beneath a rougher sea
   And whelmed in deeper gulfs than thee.
She said to herself; looking at the shore, which faced her, in a sort of amazement
[strike]& feeling[/strike] [strike]b[/strike][strike]Behind their island was another island,[/strike] & [strike]s[/strike]She
was now seeing what she had never seen in her life [strike]she was[/strike]
[strike]Now if anybody[/strike] [strike]Nothing[/strike] could have [strike][?][/strike] excited her more.
[strike]Knowing[/strike] But it seemed to her infinitely strange.
The
Her island which she
idolised [strike]did[/strike] she did not quite know why, privately, - she thought
about it in London, [strike]again[/strike] constantly: she resented other peoples
talking about it - she was furious when people talked about
going there casually, - this place which was theirs, or
really hers, [strike]had an[/strike] was like that. It was only that she was
seeing it from a new angle.
She was seeing it for the first time
It lay like that in the sea, did it; [strike]& it had[/strike]
at [strike]that moment[/strike]
Her fishing line
[strike]went[/strike]
flew out between her fingers.
[strike]The[/strike]
It seemed to
238
257
now that the boat was moving quickly that she held a hold of something
thrilling with life, a quivering sharp thread, which [strike]connected her[/strike]
[strike]with all[/strike] went down ?in & the ?word both up in the sky & down
there in the water was astonishingly queerly oddly alive & strange,
unreal, this queer morning, when one saw the island for the first time
239
259
He saw Cam looking who had been sunk in a kind of lethargy,
now look up, [strike]rather[/strike] look surprised. She had forgotten all about the contract, he
thought.
[strike]Her[/strike]
This
her
   [strike]This[/strike] island, [strike]their[/strike] island, the island she idolised privately so that it
enraged her when people said they had been to it, was like that then
she thought.
It lay like that on the sea, did it.
It had that great ?boss out
flowed in
there, & then, the sea came [strike]round[/strike] there, [strike]&[/strike]
[strike]It looked completely[/strike]
[strike]different from what[/strike] & went on for miles in a broad
?sweep passage
[strike]glittering[/strike]
to the sky.
[strike]sweep,[/strike] [strike]glittering in[/strike] the sun, as she had never seen it.
[strike]It went on;[/strike]
on & on, out there.
Where then did it go?
It was a very small
island, stuck in a vast spread of sea.
[strike]It seemed to her that they[/strike] were
[strike]adventurers, pirates, people saved from a wreck, & in obedience to[/strike]
[strike]an[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]some queer instinct which lig could made[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike]the mo made things[/strike]
[strike]go quickly & gave them an interest, she supposed that they were survivors of a[/strike]
[strike]disaster, & all depended upon her catching a fish;[/strike]
But
automatically
she began to tell herself that they were adventurers, they were a shipwrecked
crew, they had to live on the fish they caught.
[strike]She[/strike]
But at the same time she was aware [strike]of[/strike] [strike]that[/strike] [strike]it was an extrao[/strike]
how this
[strike]Even if she chose to play games,[/strike]
[strike]it was[/strike] an extraordinary occasion.
[strike]A[/strike] The island looked like that; &
She did not know the points of the compass
But she recalled herself with a jerk.
He had been annoyed with her
for not knowing the points of the compass.
But that was
But as if the sea were ?in her mind, & things
fell on the top & were
whirled away, so her father's anger, &
[strike]his[/strike] her [strike]ang[/strike] unhappiness,
at
about not knowing what to say to him [strike]& James[/strike]
[strike]be[/strike] keeping
the compact with James had slipped away in that broad glittering
[strike]path,[/strike] surface; & now a completely [strike]fresh t view had[/strike]
come.
It had changed again.
When would it stop changing?
[strike]Nobody[/strike] [strike]It was like an[/strike] There was one surprise after another.
Whether painful or pleasant, she scarcely knew.
But to be
alive & to be forced,
[strike]for no[/strike] from no will of ones own, to be
oneself, sitting in the
boat looking at that [strike][?][/strike] island was an
astonishing fact,
& her line seemed to flick with an intense
excitement, jerking
& vibrating in her fingers, & increasing [strike]the[/strike] her feeling
240
261
being
That she was [strike]somehow suspended, between[/strike] [strike]alive[/strike] a [strike]lump of matter[/strike]
which
with extraordinary capacities for feeling everything here & now - so that
disagreements & quarrels scarcely mattered [?] & with a future which it
was [strike]almost[/strike] dazzling to contemplate.
All this rushed upon her
when she looked up & saw how the island was shaped: how the sea
which the
shape of the island
seemed to start
flowing
went spreading widely over ?there; & then when this glittering
fountain had spurted up with its insensate joy, she seemed
to catch the falling drops & [strike]to[/strike] with [strike]re[/strike] new zest to apply herself to
all those [strike]unsolv[/strike] familiar half [strike]f[/strike] solved questions which, ?it
she took up at odd intervals & carried a little further; left to
half submerged
half prominent
territories
in her
mind
[strike]wait[/strike] [strike]on her[/strike] alone, & then again explored; how the world had come
into existence; about the ancient civilisations of Egyptians, Greeks & Romans;
the Byzantine Empire; [strike]the[/strike] & then whoever it might be -
Shakespeare, or
the traffic of camels & tribes marching about the
world; their conglomerations in cities, like Athens, Rome, London:
&
how [strike]during these ages, there stood up in the midst of them[/strike]
[strike]the wilds[/strike]
how one thing
followed
another;
then the great men; & then the future; & then her
[strike]father & then[/strike] instinctively she submitted all the questions
?questions
wild, rapid [strike]amb[/strike] heterogeneous
which such thoughts [strike]su[/strike]
stirred in her to his judgment. Silently, of course, without
[strike]being able[/strike] [strike]sayin[/strike] asking him about anything; for
that would have been impossible; but she had often listened to him
saying things
briefly between
puffs of
pipe smoke
talking with old men, like Mr. Carmichael or Mr. Bankes, had
[strike]coll[/strike] made a collection of little odds & ends [strike]which[/strike] they had said
but her father in particular which seemed to her, not [strike]so[/strike]
only [strike]fo[/strike] in themselves, but from the way they were said,
said incontrovertible: It was his handling of things, [strike]Wild[/strike]
fragments of
immortal
knowledge
& [strike]grotesque[/strike] So [strike]she felt[/strike] order was made to come. He walked among
all the incoherent, the wild & tumultuous ideas that come
to her
with a firm half serious tread, neatly brushing them into heaps here &
there, allowing no disorder, & [strike]then[/strike] doing it tidily easily
with complete mastery. [strike]A[/strike] [strike]Then, too, he was[/strike]
While he did this, half seriously, often with that [strike]curt[/strike]
sarcasm which sometimes made her blood boil but sometimes
with rage,
at their
rawness, their
intent to hurt;
seemed to laugh at her own strangeness [strike]la[/strike] rightly, lightly, trimly,
sagaciously, [strike]there was[/strike] he had always about him some

263
of a piece with his grey clothes, & the pipe which he held in the air & put to his lips
with fine clean gestures something level & grey & quiet: so that it seemed
[strike]to her[/strike] to go to him, to sit by him & collect there [strike]qu[/strike] little sayings of his,

was to go into a level [strike]daylit[/strike] day light: to see the whole of her
tumultuous thoughts lit up, steadily & quietly, with a peculiar
sober light - [strike]the sight[/strike] the light that was light itself: & in that,
neither
[strike]all[/strike] satire & harshness [strike]did[/strike] existed, nor temper, nor annoyance, nor
his extraordinary vanity, nor his peremptoriness, nor his tyranny
(she verified each of these qualities by looking at him) but he was

But she liked to go on with whatever was in her
mind in his presence;
for he [strike]made[/strike] [strike]the[/strike] what with his grey clothes & his
slow definite movements & his turning over the page, or neatly
[strike]finishing the[/strike] his [strike][?][/strike] [strike]regular[/strike] finishing what he was writing (

[strike][?][/strike] more exalted than the [strike]world[/strike] of the
[strike]picking up attitudes & gestures; & [/strike]
an atmosphere [strike]of[/strike] [strike]mixed[/strike] of tobacco &

some [strike]peculiar[/strike] smell peculiar to the room, [strike]which seemed to her[/strike]
a grey quiet harmonious exalted atmosphere which she
in

like a leaf in water, & if it did well there,

in his presence, in this
atmosphere of tobacco & writing &
reading The Times & saying very brief things to the other old
gentlemen, then [strike]she[/strike] it was all right.

It was impossible to get it quite clear. It was one of those

odd feeling
It was
Unpleasant, pleasant was it? Certainly very exciting.
But
of course it was against James's opinion: how he was a sarcastic brute:
so vain he always brought the talk round to himself; & what was
unforgivable, a tyrant.
Looking at the island, with its
hump & the sea beyond, she [strike]visu[/strike] fixed her mind, [strike]as if to[/strike] answer

an

[strike]quite[/strike] that [strike]thing at[/strike] [strike]which came[/strike] feeling she looked at James;

The

canvas;
It annoyed her that she had done so little work.
So far
[strike]This crud[/strike]
The morning had been full of interruptions:
she could not rid herself of this concern about Mr. Ramsay
She kept looking over her shoulder & wondering where they
got to, what they were doing.

at the moment
things were

how there was nothing for it but to shut ones eyes to that picture for a time,
wait; [strike]miserable[/strike] in such patience
as she could command: trying to
understand
what her problem was.
What was her problem then?
She was trying to get hold of something
which evaded her.
It evaded her - when she thought of the
[strike]view[/strike] picture, & when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay.
Phrases came. Visions came.
But what she wanted
to get hold of
was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been
made anything:
the germ, in painting, in knowing, of all art
&
affection.
Get that again, & start afresh, was all the advice
she could give herself.
But one got nothing by soliciting
urgently.
One got only a glare in the eyes from looking at the
line of the wall, or thinking
Mrs. Ramsay often wore
velvet shoes, & a [strike]shawl.[/strike] green

was raining.

down at the critical

[strike]capricious, incalculable.[/strike]
The whole machine
gave
out: &
then where was one?
   Well here on the lawn, she thought, kneeling to squeeze out a
a little more grass green, though she did not intend to
[strike]paint any[/strike] paint - only to do a [strike]?litt[/strike] little donkey work at
the corner of the canvas.
Kneeling on the lawn, which,
she
made herself observe,
was rather hard, for it had been on the
whole a dry summer.
There were colonies of plantain
spotting
it
[strike]about[/strike]
which ought to be
killed.

And [strike]then there was Mr.[/strike]
she would have liked to attract Mr. Carmichaels notice
somehow; [strike]or even[/strike] to have rifled his stock of ideas, or
started one of those aimless [strike]pu[/strike] pointless pleasant
conversations [strike]which[/strike] all about nothing.
250
281
[strike]?But[/strike] The old man had become rather famous lately. [strike]His name[/strike]
[strike]verge[/strike] His name [strike]was[/strike] appeared [strike]in papers[/strike] girt about with some romance
in newspapers.
People were beginning to say that Mr. Carmichael who had always been
known to a few enthusiasts, as [strike]one[/strike]
[strike]among[/strike] one
[strike]of[/strike] the finest translators [strike]of[/strike] our literature
in
time: & so on. [strike]He had written also[/strike] a few essays & [strike]some[/strike] a
book of his travels was going to be re-printed.
& in view
of this
[strike]But[/strike] he looked just the same, heavy & slow & benignant.
But she [strike]wo[/strike] could believe it -
[strike]She had liked his leisurelyness; his[/strike]
independence; & [strike]the[/strike] [strike]his one great[/strike]
It was said
that [strike]a[/strike] book he
wrote in the
70s about
traveling in
Burma
was
a masterpiece
He had that quality;
&
[strike]She[/strike]
[strike]knew one curious little[/strike] fact about him:
also this: that he
was true
"had been heart broken at Andrew[strike]s[/strike] death".
Ramsays
The phrase had come
to her casually from some [strike]one[/strike] body who knew him.
They s
in his home. [strike]They said[/strike] ?he thought all the world of him:
of Andrew
She
had a picture of him marching through Trafalgar Square
the day
[strike]the news[/strike] Andrew's name was among the killed, grasping a stick
[strike]with his old hat pulled over his eyes.[/strike]
But he was almost
entirely silent; [strike]or only said n[/strike] [strike]out[/strike] probably never said anything to
[strike]anyone, but let[/strike] certainly never had never said a word of the least
importance to her.
[strike]Yet[/strike]
People handed things round, like this, about
him now. No one had ever heard him say ?them.
[strike]And[/strike] Yet this was one of the important
most
friendships of her life -
[strike]They had never[/strike] [strike]He[/strike] [strike]They had never spoken to each other, but[/strike]
Perhaps they never would say anything.
They would go on eternally passing each other with a sort
of mumble on stairs, sitting side by side on lawns
exchanging views about the train service & the boat service
& the weather.
She had never even read his translation,
except a line or two in quotations; & then she had
recognised the quality she had felt [strike]when he[/strike]
always
something very impersonal &
extremely moving, about
a camel & the desert: something
it was
apparently very simple. but
if she had known anything about writing she would have been
sure that this was the thing that lasted for ever.
something simple but everlastingly strange.

He had the quality [strike]of[/strike] [strike]which[/strike] belongs to those who during a life
of being [strike]a ver[/strike] hospitable to ideas. What one thought about him germinated. Thus, he was a
figure of some humour. [strike]One[/strike] Took opium, never

A

   Here on the lawn, she thought, kneeling on the hard dry turf,

safely in one corner of her picture.

There were several little colonies of
plantain, she observed; & the rooks were swerving about
making black crescents & scimitars [strike]&[/strike] [strike]in the air.[/strike] with their
wings in the air.
   As for old Mr. Carmichael, lying there with his feet on a
campstool, she [strike]wondered about him[/strike] liked to be in his company on
this exalted station (for she could not shake herself free from the
sense that everything [strike]was hap[/strike] this morning was happening
for the first time & the last time; as a traveller, even

slipper hung from

252

his travels in Persia forty years ago. And somebody had said
that when he heard of Andrew Ramsay's death he had lost all interest in life.
Perhaps he had walked about the streets [strike]holding[/strike] grasping a large stick.

He had walked [strike]about[/strike] the room, he had [strike]drop[/strike] let his pipe fall, he had

not know.
[strike]He had always been[/strike]

They seldom spoke, except about the train service, & the [strike]weather[/strike]

weather.

Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly
past the drawingroom window, with a newspaper under his arm,
trying to avoid Mrs. Ramsay, whom, for some reason, he did not
much like?
She would always try to make him stop &
talk. He would bow to her.
He would halt unwittingly &
bow profoundly.
want her
   Annoyed that he [strike]did[/strike] [strike]had[/strike] [strike]did not like[/strike] her, Mrs. Ramsay would
offer all sorts of things: [strike]ask questions: was he[/strike] coats, rugs,
newspapers.
[strike]But it was no good:[/strike] There was some quality in her which
[strike]evidently repelled him.[/strike] he did not like.
He did not like,
perhaps, her masterfulness.
She was so authoritative, so
direct; [strike]&[/strike]
   A [strike]slight[/strike] noise drew her attention to the drawing room window -
the squeak of the [strike]window[/strike] hinge, as the light breeze played on the
window.
   There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily
thought.
There must have been people who thought her
253
289
too sure of herself - too drastic. Then she had no religious beliefs.
Then she
was reserved.
And (to go back to Mr. Carmichael) one could not
imagine her [strike]painting[/strike] standing painting, sitting reading a
whole
morning on the lawn. It was unthinkable.
Without saying a
word to anyone, the only token of her errand a basket on her
arm, she went off, to the
town,
to the poor,

[strike]to some[/strike]

Often & often Lily had seen her go

was of her
own
appearance)

the artichokes for the sun, [strike]makin[/strike] turning her [strike]often[/strike] infallibly to
the human race, making her seek her nest [strike]there[/strike] in its heart.
[strike]Oh no, she could ha not have stood painting[/strike]
[strike]with a[/strike]
[strike]woman dying. And there was always a woman dying.[/strike]
And this was perhaps a little distressing to Mr. Carmichael.
& to herself, too, [strike]of[/strike] secretly.
[strike]To stand painting - to sit reading[/strike]
[strike]while a woman dies a mile off in want -[/strike]
[strike]They both distrusted action? No:[/strike]
[strike]They would[/strike]
Some notion
was in both of them about
the ineffectiveness
of action; the
supremacy of thought. Her going was a reproach
to them; yet
they felt, the care of the world was more truly theirs than hers:
?or they felt, distress at their own impotence to help; or
the usual everlasting sorrow [strike]which dogged the[/strike] of the
safe at the predicament of the insecure.
[strike]In that[/strike]
On the edge of that blue sea, in the ?breast of this moorland, there is the
eternal woman dying in rags.
But
Tansley's contribution
to the
problem
was futile in the extreme.
Except for that brief moment
when he threw ducks & drakes,
[strike]& seemed like other people,[/strike]
[strike]what could[/strike]
& Mrs. Ramsay wrote
letters, what could be more
insufferable [strike]than[/strike]

The one word
"I" - he
repeated it over & over again.
As for his opinions
To her
dying day she would not forget that he paid 2d for his
254
291
tobacco. Increasingly grubby (she had heard him at a meeting) he
was no doubt the most high
principled of them all: slept out [strike]d[/strike] of doors
all the year round;
had no maids.
Incapable of telling a lie, [strike]he[/strike]
Her
own pictures she
believed were more
to the good of the race than his
preaching - though if
they were not painted over, they were given
away shamefacedly, hung in the servants bedroom.

And he had made her realise the [strike]hatred which people have for each other.[/strike]

(But she [strike]would[/strike] lost this,

Then, [strike]by a[/strike] suddenly the old cork or whatever it was began bobbing up &
down among the waves: & this strident arid [strike]rauco[/strike] [strike]ra[/strike] red faced
man on the platform became an angular boy who with all his
faults put by [strike]out of a scholarship[/strike] his earnings enough to educate a
little sister. Enormously to his credit, said Mrs. Ramsay, looking
for her spectacle case among the pebbles.
Oh dear, what a
nuisance, lost again! -
[strike]Mr. Tansley[/strike] [strike]A thousand thanks[/strike]

And he let the exaggeration pass.
One must suppose that,

put his chin

collar &

He became a

The vividness of her own sensations, standing there looking
at the

but then, she reflected, one knew
very little about other peoples sensations.
[strike]The fatal barrier[/strike]
There were barriers
between herself & Charles Tansly was this: fatal barrier:
that

never looked at a thing.

It became

And then the [strike]interpretations one[/strike] wild leaps one made, the

what stirred & trembled when the children cried, cricketing,

And then [strike]how was one to[/strike]
[strike]re[/strike] [strike]capture anything[/strike]
[strike]when he[/strike] Mr. Ramsay passed.
What a trail of curious feeling went through the whole of her,

sometimes seemed to rock her in profound agitation
upon its breast; [strike]when he spoke,[/strike] [strike]severely to James;[/strike] or
He had only to speak one word, or once

could
remember
[strike]said nothing even;[/strike]
[strike]as if now & again the presence of her[/strike]

to stoop & give her his hand up out of a

at some summer party, that she would say [strike]for the sat[/strike]

And there would fall between them sometimes long [strike]tense[/strike] rigid
silences. when, in a state of mind which Lily resented for her,
half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount the
tempest [strike]with her usual dignity,[/strike] or to laugh, as they laughed; but
(in a [strike]tacity[/strike]

perhaps concealed something.
[strike]There might be[/strike] she could not

So they would talk as usual. All would be as usual, save only
for some quiver of gaiety? tenderness? in the air which [strike]kept[/strike] went & came
between them as if the usual sight of the family dinner table
taken on a
meaning
had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears &
[strike]the[/strike] plums.
Especially, Lily thought, Mrs. Ramsay kept glancing at her
eldest daughter, Prue,.
She sat in the middle between
brothers & sisters,
always occupied, it seemed, even when she [strike]did nothing[/strike], in seeing that
was still & silent
nothing [strike]suddenly[/strike] happened wrongly.
[strike]She[/strike] [strike]Prue[/strike] must
She
have blamed herself
terribly for that earwig in the milk, Lily thought.
(Oh Lord, oh
Lord, how
did any woman
ever paint a
picture then, she
thought.)
She went
quite white.
She hated
scenes.
And now,
her
mother seemed
to be
[strike]chiding her,[/strike] making it up to her; [strike]&[/strike] assuring
[strike]to[/strike]
her that everything was
all
right now
well a[strike]g[/strike] again; [strike]& from the[/strike] to be promising her
that same
happiness -
She had enjoyed it for less than a year
however.
She had let the flowers fall from the basket -
   For that was how she went, Lily thought, screwing up her eyes
& standing back to [strike]get[/strike] look once more at that
picture; & [strike]her mind[/strike]
with all her faculties in a trance;
feeling very still, & helpless;
& yet her stillness
had an
intense
speed in it
Another [strike]ph[/strike] vision that; forming
the instant she heard of Prue's
death.
She dropped all her flowers,
scattered them & tumbled

[strike]but[/strike] - How could one

but [strike]gathering her[/strike]
unquestioningly - had she not the faculty of
obedience, [strike]that[/strike]
[strike]in[/strike] to perfection, dignified not submissive? -
[strike]Prue[/strike]
She
went;
Andrew went; [In what fields
did they walk now?
For [strike]all[/strike] they were young.
One didn't imagine that they]
They went.
[strike]But it seemed to her[/strike]
Down fields, across valleys;
white, flower strewn.
That was how she would have painted it.

She imagined the austere hills; & the hoarse waves:
The window at which she was looking was whitened by some
dress behind it; oh & shoved open! - a re-arrangement which
did not greatly matter: & now [strike]someone - w was trailing down, so[/strike] over
[strike]the steps[/strike]
There was some one there.
264
313
[It might be Rose; it might be Nancy; it might be that old woman, whats her
name, finishing her novel;
   Whoever it might be, for Heavens sake let them sit still for
& not come floundering out & talk to her.
Mercifully, whoever it was
[strike]had[/strike] settled down inside;
had settled down, by some stroke of luck,
so
as to throw a shadow there which might be useful.
A shadow was
precisely what she wanted, as it happened.
It drew
things together
It began to look rather as
though
the problem might solve itself:
[strike]she[/strike] could one only keep
on;
looking, looking, without for a second relaxing this still intensity of
emotion, this determination not be [strike]hoodwinked[/strike] [strike]bamboozled[/strike]
not to be
[strike]put off with this or that, but[/strike]
[strike]not to accept[/strike] what the
vile nature of the world proffered; lies & corruption, & the
[strike]Could one only seek intensely enough[/strike] Could one
[strike]Then[/strike] distortion, & insincerity; & all that flummery which
divides us,
now
   Was she not [strike]thinking of[/strike] almost [strike]now[/strike] in their presence?
She did
not need to assure herself that [strike]here[/strike] she [?] ?wished, [strike]more[/strike] quite
clearly t[strike]han ever before;[/strike] [strike]between the[/strike] between
[strike]was[/strike] knew what was before her, & could with a sweep of her
mind [strike]master every detail[/strike] tell the time of day: read the letters on the
back of the book even: she was [strike]not confused[/strike]
She was
[strike]Its[/strike] not confus[strike]ing[/strike]ed
not at all, she assured herself;
she was quite on a
level with ordinary experience; only,
In the presence of [strike]whom? of what?[/strike]
[strike]reality: not indeed[/strike] quite:
something troubled her
something still evaded her; [strike]but[/strike]
It was that perhaps: it was
[strike]And letting[/strike] her brush fall to her side,
she stared
wide
eyed at the drawingroom window where for a moment a
white dress so marvellously imitated [strike]the figure[/strike] she had
[strike]seen there,[/strike] [strike]ten years ago, that she could scarcely[/strike]
seen there, ten
years ago. And
He must see it, he must share it.
She turned
hastily to look
for the boat;
265
315
The white shape moved in the window.
She let her [strike]brush[/strike] arm fall
to her side.
If it was that, & it seemed to her that it was, somehow, Mrs. Ramsay herself,
where then was he?
[strike]Could one press straight on.[/strike]
it in
could one [strike]hold[/strike] the scene in a vice; [strike]without[/strike] [strike]so that[/strike] [strike]steadily,[/strike]
& let nothing [strike]harmful[/strike] from outside enter in.
One wanted to be quite on a
level with ordinary experience. [strike]One wanted to[/strike] feel thats the
chair; &
thats the table: [strike]And yet[/strike] yes: but [strike]also[/strike] [strike]so to seize them that[/strike]
[strike]the extraordinary fact was made clear for the[/strike]
[strike]they're[/strike] themselves as they [strike]have never[/strike] exist
& yet to feel, its a miracle, its [strike]a thing that has never happened before.[/strike]
a [strike]vision.[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] its an [strike]ess[/strike] ecstasy.
Ah but then [strike]most[/strike] The white thing
[strike]what[/strike] unhappily; [strike]for she did not[/strike]
[strike]something[/strike]
[strike]what was this ?[/strike]
[strike]A movement[/strike]
[strike]some trick flaunt or[/strike]
[strike]moved.[/strike] [strike]She must[/strike]
moved - the air
[strike]just[/strike] lifted some flounce: [strike]so that[/strike] her heart leapt out at her
seized her & again tortured her: [strike]with that[/strike]
Oh Mrs. Ramsay! she
cried out, letting her brush fall.
[strike]It seemed as if she were[/strike]
[strike]actually there again[/strike]
[strike]It was the devil, it was the devil to be[/strike]
[strike]thus sucked under, when one had got clear of the whole[/strike]
[strike]horror & terror; to feel the old[/strike]
There she was again; in all her force, [strike]drag[/strike] making one
stop, [strike]even now;[/strike] [strike]seizing one, & letting[/strike] & yet
making one feel again the old triumphant [strike]invincible[/strike] power:
[strike]&[/strike] how one had loved her; [strike]& she[/strike] [strike]And she had gone.[/strike] [strike]There were[/strike]
   [strike]But[/strike] [strike]And for a moment it seemed as if all[/strike] [strike][?][/strike] [strike]as[/strike] [strike]that had[/strike]

[strike]A[/strike]

317
But what was strange was that this familiar horror - to want & to want &
[strike]not to have,[/strike] then ceased. It was as if like the chair, there, Mrs. Ramsay too

had [strike]asked to ?be[/strike] be put on [strike]a[/strike] the level of ordinary experience; & so enjoy her.

it) & she knitted without any acute taste, Lily thought, in the
colour of wools;

[strike]room[/strike] was filled with that [strike]quiet[/strike] & she smiled, & she seemed to

thought
of the

it became an ecstasy: - that [strike]she should[/strike] exist. that she had lived,
[strike]And only[/strike] [strike]where[/strike]
It stayed there [strike]this[/strike] before her, while she
painted (for she began again quietly) & grew [strike]in[/strike] until at last,
she began to feel herself impelled again, by some instinct beyond her
to look for what was it, [strike]to be conscious of some[/strike]
for something - or was it some one?
   It was Mr. Ramsay she sought, [going to the edge of the lawn,
[strike]where[/strike] (Mr. Carmichael [strike]actually[/strike] nodded benevolently[strike])[/strike] to
her [strike]as she passed[/strike], feeling in some confusion that she must
somehow get [strike]him[/strike] into communication with him & tell him,
she went past Mr. Carmichael, who nodded benevolently
to the edge of the lawn, & looked out over the sea.

They were very close to the lighthouse now.
There it loomed up, stark
&
straight, [strike]on its rock[/strike],
glaring white & black
& one could
see the waves, for the wind had
at [strike]the bare [/strike]?centre rock
freshened, breaking in white splinters. Once could see the windows in the
tower, & a little bit of green on the rock.
A man had come out
 &
looked at them through a glass & gone in again:
It was
extraordinary to be able to make out one detail after another
when one had seen the lighthouse looking the same all these years
across the bay. [It was like that then, James thought.]
Behind
the Lighthouse stretching away in a vast grey sweep was the open sea.
It was like that then James thought.
It [strike]was as if he[/strike] had hoped

with some idea of life [strike]that suited him[/strike]

at the back of his
mind
He [strike]could[/strike] understand
It was what he had in common with his
father:
   That old man stood [strike]up in[/strike] a ghastly green-grey hall &
went on
telling
people to be good.
And he believed
270
325
that they were all sinking
in a waste of waters.
He liked to think so.
[strike]Sometimes for a moment[/strike] James felt that he alone understood the
[strike]irritation & the[/strike] why he was so violent & so moody & so [strike]ira[/strike]
despondent - it was because the world [strike]had[/strike] was like this - running wild
seas round stark rocks, & people went on saying no: it is
sweet & cloudy & soft.
[But it was hard, & it was bitter, & it was wild;
& for his own part, he thanked goodness he had sixty or seventy
years before him in which to do battle with it.
He would uproot
that devil -] [So he went about in those dismal places,
& [strike]stood up, very straight, & condemned vice & frivolity.[/strike]]
[strike]But he genuinely believed.[/strike]
[strike]And that was what he admired in his[/strike]
But his
father [strike]f[/strike] said no: [strike]&[/strike] his father believed that they were all sinking in a
waste of waters. He was like some old [strike]co[/strike] sea bird hunched upon a rock.

[strike]He was[/strike] aloof from them all, & [strike]sometimes James[/strike] felt that his

He didnot want pity or affection or care, or

What he had

For he did not hate him now.
He understood quite well now - that he wanted to be left in
peace to read his book.
[strike]What was his book?[/strike]
Aristotle, Plato, Greek was it?
   It was Greek, Cam thought; some foreign language anyhow.
Greek or Latin probably.
[strike]It was a[/strike] little book with a mottled
cover which he always
slipped into his pocket when he travelled.
He always read when they travelled.
Hours & hours seemed to

have passed. Nobody had spoken for an age. She had been staring up
into the sky [strike]until[/strike]. She had been trying to imagine - what was the world
really like then? [strike]Outside[/strike] In the house were all sorts of
things she knew heart; out here nothing but the sky.
[strike]What was the meaning of things?[/strike]
   The breeze had freshened a bit too much, Macalister said.

a ticklish business.

Cam thought. She had played every sort of game, she had
[strike]how[/strike]
imagined that they were shipwrecked: [strike]that[/strike] the mackerel
what the mackerel felt, drawn up there to die: she had
thought of her own bait sweeping white through the waves; how
the fish passed it. & the drowned men whirling down to the sand;

[strike]It was[/strike] For this reason:

there was nothing in the world except this - a little finger would
do to represent it - & [strike]the[/strike] her father said
"[strike]Youd shan't move[/strike] it."
No. you shant. & one had to hold it still. And
The blind ungovernable rage had possessed her. [strike]She loo[/strike]

it would have pleased him
more than

[u]12th[/u]
It was like that then, James thought. The sight confirmed him in some
notion of his, some latent idea [strike]which it pleased him to have[/strike]
some obscure
sense [strike]that he[/strike]
of his own
character;
& the nature of things
about himself, about the world, which it pleased him to find come true. -
[strike]He had, then, been right then in supposing that the[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][strike]yet what could it be?[/strike][/strike]
[strike][strike]That he had[/strike][/strike]
[strike]The[/strike]
[strike]There was a vast sweep of waters, & here & there a solitary rock. [/strike]
He alone, he thought, [strike]had tha[/strike] of all of them shared this
this suspicion
as to the
true
nature of things
this nature, this belief, with his father.
The
old ladies [strike]said,[/strike]
went chivying the ?sun about on the lawn; Mrs. Beckwith
[strike]wa[/strike] for example; & they said how charming & how sweet & how nice & all
that: & D'ya remember your mother?
Whereas, as a matter of fact,
thought James,
the world is like this:
[strike]wild & desolate;[/strike]
[strike]That was[/strike]
[strike]what his father knew too.[/strike]
[strike]He looked at[/strike] the lighthouse,
[strike]standing black & white on its rock, with the sea spreading endlessly[/strike]
[strike]beyond it.[/strike]
That [strike]wha[/strike] was what his father knew too.
The sea goes away endlessly over there; it is grey, [strike]even[/strike] in spite
of the sun even;
He looked at the Lighthouse & the sea beyond;
[strike]but only[/strike]
[strike]His father knew it too. It was the[/strike]
His father [strike]went further.[/strike] He thought
"We are driving before a gale - We [strike]are[/strike]
[strike]doo[/strike] bound to sink.
He looked at reading
His father [strike]read, with his legs curled round each[/strike]
He read steadily.
other.
The book
[strike]That he w[/strike]
   It was Greek, Cam thought, Latin or Greek. He always read
that book on a journey.
And he seemed to have been reading for
hours & hours now.
Nobody had spoken for an age.
She had looked up into the sky;
One cloud moved very slowly.
She had gazed down
into the sea.
Little bits of black cork
floated past.
She had imagined [strike]them[/strike] dying, like these fish,
beating their tails up & down in a pool of water on the
bottom of the boat;
She had imagined the drowning

men swirling round & round; & the roots of the shore, [strike]incessantly[/strike]
[strike]washed incessantly, & ris[/strike]
miles beneath, & then rising
into
clumps of trees, houses, gardens, flowers, above.
She [strike]tho[/strike] had thought too
about
tyranny & the compact to resist tyranny to the death.
Wagging her little finger to & fro in the gunwale
she acted the effort of her

grasped her little finger tight [strike]w[/strike] with her whole hand: she had thought of her father ?say

He said "I shall expect you to be
ready [strike]at[/strike] eight o'clock to come to the Lighthouse.

[strike]Yes, but what was he reading, she wondered?[/strike]
He read on, without moving. [strike]He was imperturbable.[/strike]

thus that he
escaped, [strike]for[/strike] she thought, by reason of his great nose, & his great
forehead, & the little mottled book he held, in his hand with the
signet ring. He escaped her. You had your hands on him.
And then, like a bird, he spread his wings, & floated serenely
off to settle, out of reach, on a desolate stump.
The breeze had freshened a bit too much, Macalister said.
[strike]It was[/strike] They must keep he head well up to the North he said;
[strike]But James[/strike]
It
was doing [strike]very[/strike] well, he was doing very nicely indeed. It was
keeping he very steady, he said

But did his father hear that, James wondered?
For though he could never remember a time when he had not felt,
For goodness sake don't stop (suppose his father were walking up
down the terrace, for instance, & he were playing on the step)
(it was
something
to

[strike]wh[/strike] just
now, about
the sea &
the lighthouse)
he had always felt too [strike]that[/strike]
Al the same,
I know
that too;

[strike]what he had felt[/strike]
[strike]just now about[/strike]
It [strike]was something to do with[/strike] the sea & the lighthouse:
[strike]some[/strike]
[strike]So that it suppose his father[/strike]
in virtue of which knowledge,
[strike]his father's praise, or if[/strike] his father had praised
him, or even heard Macalister praising him, he would have been
331
pleased.
But damn it all, he read.
One
He escaped [strike]always,[/strike] Cam thought.
[strike]She[/strike] might be blind with rage: (she held her
little finger tight to recall the agony, the suffocation, of his tyranny:
Do this: do that. I won't have this. Obey me instantly: & so on,)
& [strike]suddenly, it seemed[/strike] [strike]he co[/strike] [strike]just as ones hands closed[/strike]
& then, [strike]at the crisis,[/strike] ready to strike him dead as one was, [strike]off he[/strike]
[strike]it was[/strike] impossible.
[strike]Turning[/strike] [strike]She remembered[/strike]
[strike]once[/strike] [strike]a[/strike] his coming into the
[strike]room[/strike]
He stooped, she remembered,
he
picked a yellow flower.
And
her mother,
taking it with an odd little cry stuck it in her dress; [strike]instantly[/strike]
She [strike]had[/strike] let him go, [strike]too[/strike]
then
Yet it was the same sort of [strike]scene[/strike] thing precisely:
He [strike]escaped her: always, even then[/strike]
It was the same even then.
[strike]He had his little perch, out at sea, she thought,[/strike]
smiling, as she
[strike]did, son when sometimes, she came close, imagined herself his[/strike][strike][/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]very like her mother:[/strike]
333
[strike]Her cry was mixed as she remembered it - as if she[/strike]
[strike]She could not grapple with the[/strike]
It was made [strike]up[/strike] of [strike]so[/strike] amusement & some [strike]grief[/strike] despair,
thing like
the
[strike]that[/strike] little cry [strike]that[/strike] as
Cam remembered it
But it ended with
three [strike]little[/strike] drops of
[strike]pure pleasure.[/strike]
pleasure -
[strike]She also remembered,[/strike]
& the [strike]two[/strike]
Ah - ah ah. That she remembered.
for [strike]the[/strike] pure pleasure in the
sound of this.
[strike]She also remembered &[/strike] often the
two [strike]memories[/strike]
The
[strike]That[/strike] memory would [strike]join the[/strike]

something blue, pendant, swinging:

background, gave [strike]so[/strike] such a depth,

She saw the finger

which the island had shrunk.
It was sharp & thin &
[strike]fragile,[/strike] something like [strike]the[/strike]

That extraordinary
intricacy;

she thought, was that vast depth, blue, thickly
[strike]populated;[/strike]

   He would scarcely notice if the mast fell on his head, [strike]thoug[/strike] James
thought, [strike]seeing how,[/strike] watching how [strike]he brushed[/strike] his father
brushed aside the sail, when, in tacking, [strike][?][/strike] it [strike]knocked[/strike]
the brim of his hat.
His hands seemed to be appointed
335
without any consciousness on the part of the brain, [strike]to brush aside[/strike]
to see that nothing attacked him.
Yes. The hat was a nuisance. The
left hand [strike]put it on[/strike] snatched it off. There he sat, bareheaded,
with the wind blowing his hair about, & his head against the brown
[strike]sail - a head which looked[/strike] of the sail. [strike]A very, very[/strike] He looked immensely old,
James thought. He looked
as if
[strike]as if he had[/strike] done with all this.
[strike]James rememb considered how he was had forty or fifty or even sixty[/strike]
[strike]years of life before him: how he would land, & it seemed to him[/strike]
[strike]that he would ?Ja land on the Lighthouse & go on, but his father would land,[/strike]
[strike]& it would[/strike]
It was all done unconsciously automatically.
He looked as though nothing could reach him, or touch him; as though he had
[strike]embodied now that[/strike] become the very thing that had lain on the outskirts of
James's
mind since
he was a child; had become the

his legs over the sea. [strike]That[/strike] He liked that.

that wasn't quite right either. (For [strike]now he was[/strike] the sea

& yet, he looked a little different from that; he looked as if he had
had a sight of something.
Could there be land there?
He [strike]read[/strike]
went on reading
He turned the page - everything he did was full of
signs of his temper - swiftly now.
It looked as if
He was eager, [strike]it too[/strike]
to
get to the end of [strike]the section;[/strike] it
[strike]He read.[/strike] His mind
seemed to be speeding [strike]a[/strike] up & down, up & down, first

   Suddenly he shut the book with a bang, as if to say,

the change startled them.

it seemed as if

So
[strike]They were tied with thread,[/strike]

That was what he meant.
He gave to each of them a packet
tied up with ordinary sewing cotton, Cam noticed. for she felt that she
was so excited that she would notice everything now: [strike]every[/strike]

was odd;
because it [strike]was so strange;[/strike]
They were far far out at sea, [strike]almost in a[/strike]

they were excited; it was unreal, but perfectly natural.

[strike]It was almost[/strike]
[strike]impossible that they should even speak directly to each other.[/strike]
That then was the praise at last! [strike]spoken[/strike]
That was James's praise. That belonged entirely to him, Cam said to herself.
The blood mounted steadily over James's face; he looked like a little boy of
ten. [strike]He looked[/strike] rather sulky, saying to himself that he would not show
that he was pleased; he would make out that he was angry.
And now he had a chance of showing his metal. They were sailing
swiftly buoyantly on long rocking waves which [strike]seemed to[/strike]
[strike]carried the[/strike] handed them in from one to another with an
indescribable swing & exhilraration beside the reef;
on the left, [strike]all[/strike] a long row of rocks showed the brown
through the green water; & on one higher than the rest the waves [strike]spurted[/strike]
broke & spurted.
The drops went up in a column; one
could hear the slap of the water & the patter of the falling drops, &
a kind of hushing & [strike]hiss seeme[/strike] hissing sound [strike]w[/strike] from the
rolling waves, [strike]& the[/strike] flowing & falling in a kind of gamol &
that was perfectly free [strike]& ye[/strike] wild; & had gone on like this for
ever.
   Two men were out on the Lighthouse again,
looking at them,
making sure it seemed that the boat was bound for the
lighthouse, before they made some preparations.

see their faces & something glittering
on a coat.
Mr. Ramsay [strike]still[/strike] seemed to be calculating the time.
He had his
watch in his hand. He looked at the Lighthouse, & then
at the watch.
347
He seemed Cam thought to [strike]be saying[/strike] have made some bet; about the time it would
take them. He measured the space still left to sail with his eye.
[strike]And then, he shut his watch; put it back into his pocket, & looked[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]to at the island, searchingly, sadly.[/strike]
   With his watch still in his hand, he looked at the island. He sought
with his
[strike][?][/strike] [strike]keen long sighted eyes[/strike] for the dwindled leaflike shape which [strike]Cam[/strike]
[strike]had her eyes on too.[/strike] now appeared far away on a golden plate in the
middle of the sea.
What was he thinking now? she wondered. What could
What was it he sought so fixedly, so intently that [strike]she[/strike] it was painful to
staring
&

[strike]look at[/strike] him?

[strike]She[/strike] They felt both of them,

everything - [strike]As only[/strike] ask us.

We thought:

But he looked at the blue frail
shape,
which seemed to [strike]made of some[/strike] [strike]vapour burning[/strike] &
thing that had burnt itself to vapour. &
[strike]soon[/strike] it was quite clear,
they did not know what he
No; he did not want anything. He did not ask anything.

He would never tell anyone what he looked for, or

between them, with his hat off & his head exposed, he saw there.

James as if he were saying
"There is no God", & Cam
thought, "As if he were leading us [strike]upon some[/strike]
[strike]there onto[/strike] that rock" &
& they both rose to follow him as he sprang, holding his parcels,
on to the rock.

Surging up, [strike]like a[/strike] [strike]from weeds, reeds & mud,[/strike] like a river God, he seemed so
from weeds & mud
[strike]shaggy, so huge, & so benevolent,[/strike] old Mr. Carmichael stood [strike]by her side.[/strike]
beside her.
   "They [strike]will have landed[/strike]" he said.
The image stuck to him. [strike]H[/strike] Like an old Pagan god, shaggy with the weeds
[strike]of the[/strike] in his hair, & his hand
grasping a staff (but it was only [strike]his[/strike] a
French novel) he rose on the edge of the lawn, [strike]sw[/strike] swaying a

raising his hand over his eyes,

He was enormously tolerant [strike]of human weakness,[/strike] she felt, [strike]&[/strike]
He spread his hand over all their
weakness
[strike]weaknesses[/strike] [strike]infirmities[/strike]
&

Yet books [strike]do I think contain every sort of good &[/strike]

Reading
[strike]therefore[/strike]
One has to teach oneself
how to read.
And that is why it is
so extremely
difficult & also
so extremely dif interesting
89
For let us [strike]see n[/strike] stop a moment & consider what these
three girls - Mary & Elizabeth & Helen - have learnt about
reading [strike]novels.[/strike] books
They have learnt that a [strike]novelist may be trying to do[/strike]
there may be many different kinds of novel. A novel
may be a plain story like Robinson Crusoe; it may be
of adventure
a [strike]comedy of character[/strike] like Pride & Prejudice; [strike]it may be[/strike]
father &
daughter
in a
drawing
room
a [strike]novel of[/strike]
or it may be about a shepherd &
his thoughts when he is alone at night.
it may be a book in which fate or nature
plays as large a part as human character,
like [strike]Far[/strike] The Return of the Native.
[strike]Besides this,[/strike]
They will have learnt [strike]that[/strike] [strike]that no[/strike] to be on
[strike][/strike][strike]the watch for of a novelist is writing the kind of[/strike]
[strike]book[/strike] perpetually on the watch to see what kind
of book is being shaped by the novelist;
they will have noticed what [strike]kind of[/strike] language he is
using, whether it is plain & [strike]easy[/strike], direct, or full of
images & allusions.
They will [strike]and[/strike] have understood
[strike]what he is[/strike] why he is [strike]putting an emphasis,[/strike]
making a great deal of one incident & passing
completely over another.
In short they will be
doing what I think a reader ought to do - they
will be taking the writer's sentences, one after another,
& building them up in the shape he intended.

She was better, Eliza said, because an idea had occurred to her,
which she counted on her friends' help to carry out.

"to be able to look at us both while she revealed her project."
[strike]And Mr Mc[/strike] Charles Mathews returned;

grant her the last request she would ever make,
&, taking
her husbands hand, she kissed it, & [strike]kissing[/strike]

she kissed
it too,

remember made me tremble all over"

proceeded to her terrible [strike]n[/strike] a request.
Would they
pledge themselves to marry when she was dead?
Charles was thoroughly annoyed. Amelia
[strike]sobbed with ag[/strike] burst into tears.
[strike]Never, never, she[/strike]
[strike]cried could she feel[/strike]
[strike]It was impossible she cried[/strike]
Mr Matthew
fairly
scolded the
invalid
for putting them
in such
a ?position
Never she cried; it was unthinkable.
Her only feeling
for Mr Mathew was friendship & admiration.
The idea was painful, the scene distressing; only delirium
However -
could excuse it; &
for months a coldness
was between them.
[strike]However[/strike],
Then, each had a vision:
Eliza visited them
at the same moment, far apart, as they were, in their sleep.
In short, the marriage took place about twelve months later.
But what conclusions are we to come to
[strike]Th[/strike] Sterne's ghost, we might therefore [strike]deduce,[/strike] was
conclude
fundamentally a kind hearted [strike]spirit, who[/strike] creature
who if he [strike]presided[/strike]
[strike]wa[/strike] saw
one
over the disaster of one marriage,
presided
over the
[strike]saw[/strike] to it that a second, more propitious,
should succeed.
[strike]For so one might interpret the[/strike]
Charles

of the Stonegate ghost [strike]for[/strike] a hundred times
in the green
room,
& no one could [strike]acc[/strike] account for [strike]his coming, or for his[/strike]
it
[strike]going[/strike]. Again [strike]he told the story[/strike] & this time an old
widow lady, [strike]M[/strike] cried out
when suddenly
an old
widow lady,
"Why that was my dear
Billy Leng!" - And then she informed them, how her

dea Billy had been bedridden for years; how, they lodged
next door to the Mathews in Stonegate; how
as his infirmities increased, so did his fears; [strike]how[/strike] he
battered on the wall in search of robbers; how
being the most methodical of men he did this
every night as York Minster struck twelve -
In short [strike]Billy Leng was[/strike] Sterne's ghost was
