Robinson
Crusoe
Every stick & stone in the island has its own weight & shape. Nothing
moves out [strike]of the[/strike] of its sphere for a single moment. [strike]The ci artist[/strike]

Defoe takes the most stringent

[strike]every fragment is[/strike]
[strike][/strike][strike]careful & art artful precautions to to & used the most[/strike]
[strike]used[/strike]
[strike]artful devices so that we shall fall completely into the[/strike][strike][/strike]

[strike]into complete & perfect trust[/strike][strike][/strike] belief
Now it is

[strike]Sometimes[/strike]
So

of truth
Or [strike]we have[/strike] extreme particularity heightens it, [strike]or[/strike]
[strike]the whole effect being[/strike] to
The result is that
we not only believe every word he says, & [strike]come by an[/strike]
[strike]extraordina to[/strike] find all our senses of what is true
renewed
miraculously freshened & sharpened,
so that we are
for whom
custom
has made
no
dusty road
the custom like children [strike]again[/strike] taking [strike]natural objects[/strike]
in practical ways
[strike]with[/strike] enjoying life literally, [strike]engaged[/strike] in making boats,
intent
baking, building, [strike]intently[/strike] [strike]with all our faculties[/strike] absorbed
but [strike]from[/strike] this perfect seriousness [strike]something[/strike] a [strike]beauty[/strike],
& a
[strike]rises, & a[/strike]
arise that rouses in us a sense of
adventure
&
[strike]excitement[/strike], of romance. [strike]of[/strike]
Stevenson with all his
art
we are exalted
by it to [?]
up [?]
[strike]craft[/strike] never wrote
None of Stevenson's romances has
the same power; [strike]to stir no[/strike] because though [strike]every device of[/strike]
[strike]art has been emplo[/strike]yed,
they lack [strike]this the power[/strike] to
[strike]convince[/strike].
Seriousness the conviction

of truth

holds with the literal
&
ferocious simplicity. [strike]That[/strike]
vociferously that nothing

plain earthenware pot & to realise that
everything - God, man, nature, must give way.
One thing [strike]being[/strike] realised with perfect truth - &
is
all the others therefore fall into perfect
perspective.
Nor does there seem to be any reason
seen against
a ?craggy
why the perspective wh an earthenware pot entails is
not as satisfying,
once it is perceived [strike]as that[/strike]
man himself, gloomy & angered,
[strike]surrounded[/strike]
with a broken & tumultuous
panorama of
clouds
[strike]stars[/strike] & alps & stars

the full
value
of facts
The result is that we believe implicitly, & [strike]do seek from belief all[/strike]
to &
to imbibe without any shadow of doubt. [strike]w[/strike] [strike]All[/strike]
[strike]Our[/strike] first
therefore
w
sense of [strike]the f[/strike] the [strike]ple[/strike] importance of facts [strike]is miraculously[/strike]

the delight
renewed, so that [strike]we are like children, taking liter[/strike]ally

& [strike]then[/strike]
building baking hunting cooking; [strike]Then the[/strike]
all the
savour
& the

in the atmosphere so vivid &
& then the astonishment of incidents - like the
wild cat or the goat or the foot prints, seems to
expand to its full; & the story moves on not to
[strike]with all[/strike] a king of regular unexaggerated normal [strike]step[/strike], march
but
not to catastrophe, [strike]but[/strike] inevitably to prosperity, [strike]but[/strike]
gathering as it goes, from its perfect seriousness,
taking
a
[strike]true[/strike] certain
grandeur.
Writers who live at the same moment [strike]yet[/strike] use
[?]
Any vagueness about God for example, any introspection
into the soul
[strike]into the soul[/strike][strike][/strike]
any [strike]aeth a[/strike] feeling for the beauty of nature
would have
weakened the massive effect of [strike]what[/strike] fact.
[strike]tunnelled.[/strike]
And again we ask ourselves, what is reality?
do we mean when we talk about
87
But why is it so difficult?
Because nobody can teach it.
Now if you say Rome is the capital of France, your

teacher
teacher can say Nonsense:
If you say [strike]Henry the Eighth[/strike]
King John had 8 wives; your teacher can say:
Nonsense
Henry the 8th had 8 wives.
These are facts
[strike]These are facts.[/strike]
But if you say, Robinson Crusoe is a bad book, nobody
can say that
it is, or that
it is not.
can prove [strike]that[/strike] you right [strike]or prove that[/strike] you are wrong.
[strike]One has to[/strike]
[strike]No one can teach you to[/strike]
Yet books [strike]do I think contain every sort of good &[/strike]
[strike]Books[/strike] cannot be taught.
Reading
[strike]therefore[/strike]
One has to teach oneself
how to read.
And that is why it is
so extremely
difficult & also
so extremely dif interesting
89
For let us [strike]see n[/strike] stop a moment & consider what these
three girls - Mary & Elizabeth & Helen - have learnt about
reading [strike]novels.[/strike] books
They have learnt that a [strike]novelist may be trying to do[/strike]
there may be many different kinds of novel. A novel
may be a plain story like Robinson Crusoe; it may be
of adventure
a [strike]comedy of character[/strike] like Pride & Prejudice; [strike]it may be[/strike]
father &
daughter
in a
drawing
room
a [strike]novel of[/strike]
or it may be about a shepherd &
his thoughts when he is alone at night.
it may be a book in which fate or nature
plays as large a part as human character,
like [strike]Far[/strike] The Return of the Native.
[strike]Besides this,[/strike]
They will have learnt [strike]that[/strike] [strike]that no[/strike] to be on
[strike][/strike][strike]the watch for of a novelist is writing the kind of[/strike]
[strike]book[/strike] perpetually on the watch to see what kind
of book is being shaped by the novelist;
they will have noticed what [strike]kind of[/strike] language he is
using, whether it is plain & [strike]easy[/strike], direct, or full of
images & allusions.
They will [strike]and[/strike] have understood
[strike]what he is[/strike] why he is [strike]putting an emphasis,[/strike]
making a great deal of one incident & passing
completely over another.
In short they will be
doing what I think a reader ought to do - they
will be taking the writer's sentences, one after another,
& building them up in the shape he intended.
[u]The Ghost of Sterne[/u]
She was better, Eliza said, because an idea had occurred to her,
which she counted on her friends' help to carry out.
before her husband came back
First she wished to be propped up in bed, in order, she said
"to be able to look at us both while she revealed her project."
[strike]And Mr Mc[/strike] Charles Mathews returned;
her
The project was
[strike]reveal soon revealed directly[/strike]
when
Charles Mathews returned.
Sitting up in bed & looking [strike]at them both, Eliza announced[/strike]
rent
She astonished [strike]& their hearts by saying what they[/strike]
The project was revelaed.
Sitting up in bed, looking
at them both, often forced to pause for breath,
she
[strike]eve reveal[/strike] explained [strike]the design which[/strike] how she knew she
must die, how she thought of her husbands loneliness distressed her,
& more the thought that he would marry again a
328
woman who would not understand him[strike];[/strike]
Were her
Wits wandering, the couple wondered, as she paused exhausted.
Next
[strike]Then[/strike] she proceeded, [strike]the[/strike] Amor[strike]rilas[/strike] own state worried

weighed upon her mind
her,
[strike]so[/strike] with
her
[strike]young, so inexperienced[/strike], youth & inexperience.
[strike]Her[/strike]
[strike]surely they would[/strike]
[strike]Realising this[/strike], surely they would
she
grant her the last request she would ever make,
&, taking
her husbands hand, she kissed it, & [strike]kissing[/strike]
taking
Amerllis
she kissed
it too,
hand too
"in a solemn manner which I
remember made me tremble all over"
&

?pled
then
frame
[?]
proceeded to her terrible [strike]n[/strike] a request.
Would they
pledge themselves to marry when she was dead?
Charles was thoroughly annoyed. Amelia
[strike]sobbed with ag[/strike] burst into tears.
[strike]Never, never, she[/strike]
[strike]cried could she feel[/strike]
[strike]It was impossible she cried[/strike]
Mr Matthew
fairly
scolded the
invalid
for putting them
in such
a ?position
Never she cried; it was unthinkable.
Her only feeling
for Mr Mathew was friendship & admiration.
The idea was painful, the scene distressing; only delirium
However -
could excuse it; &
for months a coldness
was between them.
[strike]However[/strike],
Then, each had a vision:
Eliza visited them
at the same moment, far apart, as they were, in their sleep.
In short, the marriage took place about twelve months later.
But what conclusions are we to come to
[strike]Th[/strike] Sterne's ghost, we might therefore [strike]deduce,[/strike] was
conclude
fundamentally a kind hearted [strike]spirit, who[/strike] creature
who if he [strike]presided[/strike]
[strike]wa[/strike] saw
one
over the disaster of one marriage,
presided
over the
[strike]saw[/strike] to it that a second, more propitious,
should succeed.
[strike]For so one might interpret the[/strike]
Charles
told the story
of the Stonegate ghost [strike]for[/strike] a hundred times
in the green
room,
& no one could [strike]acc[/strike] account for [strike]his coming, or for his[/strike]
it
[strike]going[/strike]. Again [strike]he told the story[/strike] & this time an old
widow lady, [strike]M[/strike] cried out
when suddenly
an old
widow lady,
"Why that was my dear
Billy Leng!" - And then she informed them, how her

dea Billy had been bedridden for years; how, they lodged
next door to the Mathews in Stonegate; how
as his infirmities increased, so did his fears; [strike]how[/strike] he
battered on the wall in search of robbers; how
being the most methodical of men he did this
every night as York Minster struck twelve -
In short [strike]Billy Leng was[/strike] Sterne's ghost was
bedridden Billy Leng.
