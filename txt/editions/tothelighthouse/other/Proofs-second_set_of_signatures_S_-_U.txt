head, or ran across the grass, or scolded Kennedy,
the gardener? Who could tell her? Who could
help her?
   Against her will she had come to the surface,
and found herself half out of the picture, looking,
a little dazedly, as if at unreal things, at Mr.
Carmichael. He lay on his chair with his hands
clasped above his paunch not reading, or sleeping,
but basking like a creature gorged with existence.
His book had fallen on to the grass.
   She wanted to go straight up to him and say,
“Mr. Carmichael!” Then he would look up
benevolently as always, from his smoky vague
green eyes. But one only woke people if one
knew what one wanted to say to them. And she
wanted to say not one thing, but everything.
Little words thatbroke up the thought and dis-
membered it said nothing. "About life, about
death; about Mrs. Ramsay"—no, she thought,
one could say nothing to nobody. The urgency
of the moment always missed its mark. Words
fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too
low. Then one gave it up; then the idea sunk
back again; then one became like most middle-
aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles
between the eyes and a look of perpetual appre-
hension. For how could one express in words
these emotions of the body? express that empti-

[strike][violet]acute.[/violet][/strike]  For in one moment if there was no breeze,
his father would slap the covers of his book to-
gether, and say: “What’s happening now? What
are we dawdling about here for, eh?” as, once
before he had brought his blade down among them
on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over, and if
there had been an axe handy, a knife, or anything
with a sharp point he would have seized it and
struck his father through the heart. She had gone
stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so that
he felt she listened to him no longer, she had risen
somehow and gone away and left him there,
impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping
a pair of scissors.
   Not a breath of wind blew. The water
chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat
where three or four mackerel beat their tails up
and down in a pool of water not deep enough to
cover them. At any moment Mr. Ramsay (he
scarcely dared look at him) might rouse himself,
shut his book, and say something sharp; but for
the moment he was reading, so that James

could almost fancy that had Carmichael spoken,
for instance, a little tear would have rent the
surface. And then? Something would emerge.
A hand would be shoved up, a blade would be or
flashed. It was nonsense of course.
   A curious notion came to her that he did after
all hear the things she could not say. He was an
inscrutable old man, with the yellow stain on his
beard, and his poetry, and his puzzles, sailing
serenely through a world which satisfied all his
wants, so that she thought he had only to put
down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish
up anything he wanted. She looked at her
picture. That would have been his answer,
presumably—how "you" and "I" and "she"
pass and vanish—nothing stays; all changes; but
not words, not paint. Yet it would be hung in
the attics, she thought; it would be rolled up and
flung under a sofa; yet even so, even of a picture
like that, it was true. One might say, even of
this scrawl, not of that actual picture, perhaps,
but of what it attempted, that it "remained for
ever", she was going to say, or, for the words
spoken sounded even to herself, too boastful, to
hint, wordlessly; when, looking at the picture, she
was surprised to find that she could not see it.
Her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did not
think of tears at first) which, without disturbing

Cam’s foot, over anybody’s foot. One sat and
watched it.
   But whose foot was he thinking of, and in what
garden did all this happen? For one had settings
for these scenes; trees that camethere; flowers
there; a certain light; a few figures. Everything
tended to set itself in a garden; there was none
of this gloom. None of this throwing of hands
about; people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice.
They went in and out all day long. There was an
old woman gossiping in the kitchen; and the
blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze; all
was blowing, all was growing; and over all those
plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and
yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be
drawn, like a vine leaf, at night. Things became
tendererand darker at night. But the leaf—like
veil was so fine,so thin that lights lifted it, voices
crinkled it; he could see through it a figure
stooping, hear, coming close, going away, some
dress rustling, some chain tinkling.
   It was in this world that the wheel went over the
person's foot. Something, he remembered, stayed
and darkened over him; would not move; some-
thing flourished up in the air, something arid and
sharp descended even there, like a blade, a scimitar,
smiting through the leaves and flowers even of
that happy world and making it shrivel and fall.

   “Mrs. Ramsay!" Lily cried, "Mrs. Ramsay!”
But nothing happened. The pain increased.
Thatanguish could reduce one to such a pitch of
imbecility, she thought! Anyhow the old man
had not heard her. He remained benignant,
calm—if one chose to think it, sublime. Heaven
be praised, no one had heard her cry that igno-
minious cry, stop pain, stop! She had not
obviously taken leave of her senses. No one had
seen her step off her strip of board into the waters
of annihilation. She remained a skimpy old maid,
holding a paint-brush.
   And now slowly the pain of the want, and the
bitter anger (to be called back, just as she thought
she would never feel sorrow for Mrs. Ramsay
again,testing it at breakfast.Had she missed her
among the coffee cups?not in the least) lessened;
and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief that
was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously,
a sense of some one there, of Mrs. Ramsay, re-
lieved for a moment of the weight that the world
had put on her, staying lightly by her side and

old man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it
was the thing that descended on him—without
his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden
black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak
all cold and hard, that struck and struck at you
(he could feel the beak on his bare legs, where it
had struck when he was a child) and then made
off, and there he was again, an old man, very sad,
reading his book. That he would kill, that he
would strike to the heart. Whatever he did—
(and he might do anything, he felt, looking at the
Lighthouse and the distant shore) whether he
was in a business, in a bank, a barrister, a man
at the head of some enterprise, that he would
fight, that he would track down and stamp out—
tyranny, despotism, he called it—making people
do what they did not want to do, cutting off their
right to speak. How could any of them say,
But I won’t, when he said, Come to the Light-
house. Do this. Fetch me that. The black
wings spread, and the hard beak tore. And then
next moment, there he sat reading his book; and
he might look up—one never knew—quite
reasonably. He might talk to the Macalisters.
He might be pressing a sovereign into some
frozen old woman’s hand in the street, James
thought, and he might be shouting out at some
fisherman’s sports; he might be waving his arms

roused as usual by something incongruous. There
was a brown spot in the middle of the bay. It
was a boat. Yes, she realised that after a second.
But whose boat? Mr. Ramsay’s boat, she replied.
Mr. Ramsay was the man,the man who had
marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at
the head of a procession, in his beautiful boots,
asking her for sympathy, which she had refused.
The boat was now half way across the bay.
   So fine was the morning except for a streak of
wind here and there that the sea and sky looked
all one fabric, as if sails were stuck high up in the
sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the sea.
A steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a
great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving
and circling decoratively, as if the air were a fine
gauze which held things and kept them softly in
its mesh, only gently swaying them this way and
that. And as happens sometimes when the
weather is very fine, the cliffs looked as if they
were conscious of the ships, and the ships looked
as if they were conscious of the cliffs, as if they
signalled to each other some message of their
own. Sometimes quite close to the shore, the
Lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an
enormous distance away.
   “Where are they now?" Lily thought,
looking out to sea. Where was he, that very old
280
THE LIGHTHOUSE
man who had gone past her silently, holding a
brown paper parcel under his arm? The boat
was in the middle of the bay.
9
   They don’t feel a thing there, Cam thought,
looking at the shore, which rising and falling,
became steadily more distant and more peaceful.
Her hand cut a trail in the sea, as her mind
made the green swirls and streaks into patterns
and numbed and shrouded wandered in imagina-
tion in that underworld of waters where the pearls
stuck in clusters to white sprays, where in the
green light a change came over one’s entire mind
and one’s body was half transparent enveloped in
a green cloak.
   Then the eddy slackened round her hand.
The rush of the water ceased; the world became
full of little creaking and squeaking sounds. One
heard the waves breaking and flapping against
the side of the boat as if they were anchored in
harbour. Everything became very close to one.
For the sail, upon which James had his eyes fixed
until it had become to him like a person whom
he knew, sagged entirely; there they came to a
stop, flapping aboutwaiting for a breeze, in the
hot sun, miles from shore, miles from the Light-
281
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
house. Everything in the whole world seemed
to stand still. The Lighthouse became immov-
able, and the line of the distant shore became
fixed. The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed
to come very close together and to feel each other’s
presence, which they had almost forgotten.
Macalister’s fishing line went plumb down into
the sea. But Mr. Ramsay went on reading with
his legs curled under him.
   He was reading a little shiny book with covers
mottled like a plover's egg. Now and again, as
they hung about in that horrid calm, he turned
a page. And James felt that each page was
turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him: now
assertively, now commandingly; now with the
intention of making people pity him; and all the
time, as his father read and turned one after
another of those little pages, James kept dreading
the moment when he would look up and speak
sharply to him about something or other. Why
were they lagging about here? he would demand,
or something quite unreasonable like that. And
if he does, James thought, then I shall take a
knife and strike him to the heart.
   He had always kept this old symbol of taking a
knife and striking his father to the heart. Only
now, as he grew older, and sat staring at his
father in an impotent rage, it was not him, that
282

with which she went. Lily squeezed her tubes
again. She attacked that problem of the hedge.)
It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping
with her usual quickness across fields among those
folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers,
hyacinths or lilies, she vanished. It was some
trick of the painter’s eye. For days after she had
heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting
her wreath to her foehead and going unquestion-
ingly with her companion, across the fields. The
sight, the phrase, had its power to console.
Wherever she happened to be, painting, here, in
the country or in London, the vision would come
to her, her eyes, half closing, sought something
to base her vision on. She looked down the rail-
way carriage, the omnibus; took a line from
shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows
opposite; at Piccadilly, lamp-strung in the
evening. All had been part of the fields of death.
But always something—it might be a face, a voice,
a paper boy crying Standard, News—thrust
through, snubbed her, waked her, required and
got in the end an effort of attention, so that the
vision must be perpetually remade. Now again,
moved as she was by some instinctive need of
distance and blue, she looked at the bay beneath
her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves,
and stony fields of the purpler spaces, she was

in the air with excitement. Or he might sit at the
head of the table dead silent from one end of
dinner to the other. Yes, thought James, while
the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot
sun; there was a waste of snow and rock very
lonely and austere; and there he had come to
feel, quite often lately, when his father said some-
thing or did something which surprised the others,
there were two pairs of footprints only; his own
and his father's. They alone knew each other.
What then was this terror, this hatred? Turning
back among the many leaves which the past had
folded in him, peering into the heart of that
forest where light and shade so chequer each other
that all shape is distorted, and one blunders,
floundersnow with the sun in one’s eyes now with
a dark shadow, looking into the past he sought an
image to cool and detach and round off his feeling
in a concrete shape. Suppose then that as a child
sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some-
one’s knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly
and innocently, someone’s foot? Suppose he had
seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole;
then the wheel; and the same foot, purple,
crushed. But the wheel was innocent. So now,
when his father came striding down the passage
knocking them up early in the morning to go to
the Lighthouse down it came over his foot, over
284
THE LIGHTHOUSE
the firmness of her lips, made the air thick, rolled
down her cheeks. She had perfect control of
herself—Oh yes!—in every other way. Was she
crying then for Mrs. Ramsay, without being
aware of any unhappiness? She addressed old
Mr. Carmichael again. What was it then? What
did it mean? Could things thrust their hands up
and grip one; the blade cut; the fist grasp? Was
there no safety? No learning by heart of the ways
of the world? No guide, no shelter, but all was
miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower
into the air? Could it be, even for elderly people,
that this was life?—startling, unexpected, un-
known? For one moment she felt that if they
both got up, herenow on the lawn, and demanded
an explanation, why was it so short, why was it
so inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully
equipped human beings from whom nothing should
be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll itself
up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes
would form into shape; if they shouted loud enough
Mrs. Ramsay would return. "Mrs. Ramsay!”
she said aloud, "Mrs. Ramsay!" The tears ran
down her face.

   “It will rain,” he remembered his father
saying. “You won’t be able to go to the
Lighthouse.”
   The Lighthouse was then a silvery, misty-
looking tower with a yellow eye, openingsuddenly,
softly. Now—
   James looked at the Lighthouse. He could
see the white-washed rocks; the tower, stark and
straight; he could see that it was barred with
black and white; he could see windows in it; he
could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry.
So that was the Lighthouse, was it?
   No, the other was also the Lighthouse. For
nothing was simply one thing. The other
Lighthouse was true too. It was sometimes hardly
to be seen across the bay. In the evening one
looked up and saw the eye opening and shutting
and the light seemed to reach them in that airy
sunny garden where they sat.
   But he pulled himself up. Whenever he said
“they” or “a person”, and then began hearing
the rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of some
one going, [violet][^][/violet]

or that laugh which ended with three
separate “ahs”, each less than the last, like drops
wrung from the heart of merriment, it meant that
he was drawing near the thing he did not want to
think about (his mother), since it was terrible and
horrible to think of her with his father near; it

ness there? (She was looking at the drawing-room
steps; they looked extraordinarily empty). It was
one’s body feeling, not one’s mind. The physical
sensations that went with the bare look of the
steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant.
To want and not to have, sent all up her body a
hardness, a hollowness, a strain. And then to
want and not to have—to want and want—how
that wrung the heart, and wrung it again and
again! Oh Mrs. Ramsay! she called out silently,
to that essence which sat by the boat, that abstract ,
one made of her, that woman in grey, as if to
abuse her for having gone, and then having gone,
come back again. It had seemed so safe, thinking
of her. Ghost, air, nothingness, a thing you could
play with easily and safely at any time of day or
night, she had been that, and then suddenly she
put her hand out and wrung the heart thus.
Suddenly, the empty drawing-room steps, the
frill of the chair inside, the puppy tumbling on the
terrace, the whole wave and whisper of the garden
became like curves and arabesques flourishing
round a centre of complete emptiness.
   “What is death?
does
it mean?
How do you explain it all?"
she wanted to say, turning to Mr. Carmichael
again. For the whole world seemed to have dis-
solved in this early morning hour into a pool of
thought, a deep basin of intense reality, and one

did she go that day?
Hebegan following her
from room to room and at last they came to a
room where in a blue light, as if the reflection
came from many china dishes, she talked to some-
body; he listened to her talking. She talked to
a servant, saying simply whatever came into her
head. She alone spoke the truth; to her alone
could he speak it. That was the source of her
everlasting attraction for him, perhaps; she was
a person to whom one could say what came into
one's head

a new carpet for the staircase. And once some-
thing led him to talk about the Ramsays and
he had said how when he first saw her she had
been wearing a grey hat; she was not more
than nineteen or twenty. She was astonishingly
beautiful. There he stood looking down the
avenue at Hampton Court, in what Lily had once
called a rapture.
   She looked now at the drawing-room step.
She saw, through William’s eyes, the shape of a
woman, peaceful and silent, with downcast eyes.
She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that
day, Lily thought). Her eyes were bent. She
would never lift them. Yes, thought Lily, looking
intently, I must have seen her look like that, but
not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so
peaceful.The figure came readily enough. She
was astonishingly beautiful, as William said.
But beauty was not everything. Beauty had this
penalty—it came too readily, came too com-
pletely.It stilled life—froze it. One forgot the
little agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer
distortion, some light or shadow, which made the
face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a
quality one saw for ever after. It was simpler to
smooth that all out under the cover of beauty.
But what was the look she had, Lily wondered,

   There he sat with his hand on the tiller in the
sun, staring at the Lighthouse, powerless to move,
powerless to flick off these grains of misery which
settled on his mind one after another. A rope
seemed to bind him there, and his father had
knotted it and he could only escape by taking a
knife and plunging it. . . . But at that moment
the sail swung slowly round, filled slowly out, the
boat seemed to shake herself awake, and then to
move off half conscious in her sleep, and then she
woke and shot through the waves. The relief was
extraordinary. They all seemed to fall away from
each other again and to be at their ease and the
fishing-lines slanted taut across the side of the
boat. But his father did not rouse himself. He
only raised his right hand mysteriously high in

went off to the town, to the poor there, to sit in
some stuffy little bedroom. Often and often Lily
had seen her go silently in the midst of some
game, some discussion, with her basket on her
arm, very upright. She had noted her return.
She had thought, half laughing (she was so
methodical with the tea cups) half moved (her
beauty took one’s breath away) eyes that are
closing in pain have looked on you. You have
been with them there.
   And then Mrs. Ramsay would be annoyed
because somebody was late, or the butter not
fresh, or the teapot chipped. And all the time
she was saying that the butter was not fresh one
would be thinking of anemones and Greek
temples, and how beauty had been with them
there in that stuffy little room. She never talked
of it—she went, punctually, directly. It was her
instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for
the south, the artichokes for the sun, turning her
infallibly to the human race, making hernest in
its heart. And this, like all instincts, was a little
distressing to people who did not share it; to
Mr. Carmichael perhaps, to herself certainly.
Some notion was in both of them about the
ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought,

from a sinking ship. But with the sea streaming
through her fingers, a spray of seaweed vanishing
behind them, she did not want to tell herself
seriously a story; it was the sense of adventure
and escape that she wanted, for she was thinking,
as the boat sailed on, how her father’s anger about
the points of the compass, James’s obstinacy about
the compact, and her own anguish, all had slipped,
all had passed, all had streamed away. What then
came next? Where were they going? From her
hand, ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted
up a fountain of joy at the change, at the escape,
at the adventure (that she should be alive, that she
should be there). And the drops falling from this
sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here
and there on the dark, the slumbrous shapes in
her mind; shapes of a world not realised but
turning in their darkness, catching here and there,
a spark of light; Greece, Rome, Constantinople.
Small as it was, and shaped something like a leaf
stood on its twigwith the gold sprinkled waters
flowing in and about it, it had, she supposed, a
place in the universe—even that little island?
The old gentlemen in the study could have told
her. Sometimes she strayed in from the garden
purposely to catch them at it. There they were

was sitting with her father) sitting opposite each

falgar Square grasping a big stick? Had he
turned pages over and over, without reading them,
sitting in his room in St. John`s Wood alone?
She did not know what he had done, when he
heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in
him all the same. They only mumbled at each
other on staircases; they looked up at the sky
and said it will be fine or it won't be fine. But
this was one way of knowing people, she thought:
to know the outline, not the detail, to sit in one`s
garden and look at the slopes of a hill running
purple down into the distant heather. She knew
him in that way. She knew that he had changed
somehow. She had never read a line of his poetry.
She thought she knew how it went though, slowly
and sonorously. It was seasoned and mellow. It
was about the desert and the camel. It was about
the palm tree and the sunset. It was extremely
impersonal; it said something about death; it said
very little about love. There was an imperson-
ality about him. He wanted very little of other
people. Had he not always lurched rather
awkwardly past the drawing-room window with
some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid
Mrs. Ramsay whom for some reason he did not
much like? On that account, of course, she would
always try to make him stop. He would bow to
her. He would halt unwillingly and bow pro-
301
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
Lest this should be wrong, she looked at him
reading the little book with the shiny cover
mottled like a plover’s egg. No; it was right.
Look at him now, she wanted to say aloud to
James. (But James had his eye on the sail.) He
is a sarcastic brute, James would say. He brings
the talk round to himself and his books; James
would say. He is intolerably egotistical. Worst
of all, he is a tyrant. But look! she said, looking
at him. He may be thinking.Look at him now.
She looked at him reading the little book with
his legs curled; the little book whose yellowish
pages she knew, without knowing what was written
on them. It was small; it was closely printed;
on the fly-leaf she knew, he had written that he
had spent fifteen francs on dinner; the wine had
been so much; he had given so much to the
waiter; all was added up nearly at the bottom of
the page. But what might be written in the book
which had rounded its edges off in his pocket, she
did not know. What he thought they none of
them knew. But he was absorbed in it, so that
when he looked up, as he did now for an instant,
it was not to see anything; it was to pin down
some thought exactly. That done, his mind
flew back again and he plunged into his reading.
He read, she thought, as if he were guiding some-
thing, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or

her when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay; it evaded
her now when she thought of her picture. Phrases
came. Visions came.  Beautiful pictures. Wreaths
of flowers.Beautiful phrases. The Bride of
Death.But what she wished to get hold of was
that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before
it has been made anything. Get that and start
afresh; get that and start afresh; she said
desperately, pitching herself firmly again before
her easel. It was a miserable machine, an in-
efficient machine, she thought, the human appar-
atus for painting or for feeling; it always broke
down at the critical moment; heroically, one must
force it on. She stared, frowning. There was the
hedge, sure enough. But one got nothing by
soliciting urgently. One got only a glare in the
eye from looking at the line of the wall, or from
thinking. She wore a grey hat. She was aston-
ishingly beautiful. Let it come, she thought, if
it will come. For there are moments when one
can neither think nor feel. And if onecan neither
think nor feel, she thought, where is one?
   Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought,
sitting down, and examining with her brush a
little colony of plantains. For the lawn was very
rough. Here sitting on the world, she thought,
for she could not shake herself free from the sense
that everything this morning was reduced to a
299

seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she
thought, upon distance: whether people are near
us or far from us; for her feeling for Mr. Ramsay
changed as he sailed further and further across
the bay. It seemed to be elongated, stretched out;
he seemed to become more and more remote. He
and his children seemed to be swallowed up in
that blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn,
close at hand, Mr. Carmichael suddenly grunted.
She laughed. He clawed his book up from the
grass. He settled into his chair again puffing and
blowing like some sea monster. That was different
altogether, because he was so near. And now
again all was quiet. They must be out of bed by
this time, she supposed, looking at the house, but
nothing appeared there. But then, she remem-
bered, they had always made off directly a meal
was over, on business of their own. It was all in
keeping with this silence, this emptiness, and the
unreality of the early morning hour. It was a way
things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a
moment and looking at the long glittering windows
and the plume of blue smoke: they became
unreal. So coming back from a journey, or after
an illness, before habits had spun themselves
across the surface, one felt that same unreality,
which was so startling; felt something emerge.
Life was most vivid then. One could be at one’s
296
THE LIGHTHOUSE
ease. Mercifully one need not say, very briskly,
crossing the lawn to greet old Mrs. Beckwith, who
would be coming out to find a corner to sit in,
“Oh good-morning, Mrs. Beckwith! What a
lovely day! Are you going to be so bold as to sit
in the sun? Jasper’s hidden the chairs. Do let me
find you one!" and all the rest of the usual
chatter. One need not speak at all. One glided,
one shook one’s sails (there was a good deal of
movement in the bay, boats were starting off—
between things, beyond things. Empty it was not,
but full to the brim. She seemed to be standing
up to the lips in some substance, to move and
float and sink in it, yes, tor these waters were un-
fathomably deep. Into them had spilled so many
lives. The Ramsays’; the children’s; and all
sorts of waifs and strays of things besides. A
washerwoman with her basket; a rook, a red-hot
poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers:
and something holding it together.
   It was some such feeling of completeness
perhaps which, ten years ago, standing almost
where she stood now, had made her say that she
must be in love with the place. Love had a
thousand shapes. There might be lovers whose
gift it was to choose out the elements of things
and place them together and so, giving them a
wholeness not theirs in life, make of some scene,
297
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
or meeting of people (all now gone and separate),
one of those globed compacted things over which
thought lingers, and love plays.
   Her eyes rested on the brown speck of Mr.
Ramsay’s sailing boat. They would be at the
Lighthouse by lunch time she supposed. But the
wind had freshened, and, as the sky changed
slightly and the sea changed slightly and the
boats altered their positions, the view, which a
moment before had seemed miraculously fixed,
was now unsatisfactory. The wind had blown the
trail of smoke about; there was something dis-
pleasing about the placing of the ships.
   The disproportion there seemed to upset some
harmony in her own mind. She felt an obscure
distress. It was confirmed when she turned to
her picture. She had been wasting her morning.
For whatever reason she could not achieve that
razor edge of balance between two opposite
forces; Mr. Ramsay and the picture; which was
necessary? There was something perhaps wrong
with the design? Was it, she wondered, that the
line of the wall wanted breaking, was it that the
mass of the trees was too heavy? She smiled
ironically; for had she not thought, when she
began, that she had solved her problem?
   What was the problem then? She must try to
get hold of something that evaded her. It evaded

pushing his way up and up a single narrow path;
and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke
his way through the bramble, and sometimes it
seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded
him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten
by that; on he went, tossing over page after page.
And she went on telling herself a story about
escaping from a sinking ship for she was safe,
while he sat there; safe, as she felt herself when
she crept in from the garden, and took a book
down and the old gentleman, lowering the paper
suddenly, said something very brief over the top
of it about the character of Napoleon.
   She gazed back over the sea, at the island.
But the leaf was losing its sharpness. It was very
small; it was very distant. The sea was more
i important now than the shore. Waves were all
round them, tossing and sinking, with a log
wallowing down one wave; a gull riding on
another. About here, she thought, dabbling her
fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she
murmured, dreamily half asleep, how we perished,
each alone.
12
   So much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe,
looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it,
which was so soft that the sails and the clouds

simpler form,was happening for the first time,
perhaps for the last time, as a traveller, even
though he is half asleep, must rub a space on the
window,knows, looking out of the train,that he
must look now, for he will never see that town,
or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the
fields, again. The lawn was the world; they were
up here together, on this exalted station, she
thought, looking at old Mr. Carmichael, who
seemed (though they had not said a word all this
time) to share her thoughts. And she would
never see him again perhaps. He was growing
old. Also, she remembered, smiling at the slipper
that dangled from his foot, he was growing
famous. People said that his poetry was "so
beautitul!” They went and published things he
had written forty years ago. There was a famous
man now called Carmichael, she smiled, thinking
how many shapes one person might wear, how he
was that in the newspapers, but here the same as
he had always been. He looked the same—
greyer, rather. Yes, he looked the same, but
somebody had said, she recalled, that when he
had heard of Andrew Ramsay’s death (he was
killed in a second by a shell; he should have been
a great mathematician) Mr. Carmichael had "lost
all interest in life." What did it mean—that?
she wondered. Had he marched through Tra-

other in their low arm-chairs. They were
crackling in front of them the pages of [i]The Times[/i],
when she came in from the garden, all in a muddle,
about something some one had said about Christ,
or [strike][violet]hearing[/violet][/strike][strike][violet] that[/violet][/strike]
[violet]about[/violet]

London street, or [strike][violet]wondering what[/violet][/strike]

Napoleon was
like. Then they took all this with their clean
hands (they wore grey coloured clothes; they
smelt of heather) and they brushed the scraps
together, turning the paper, crossing their knees,
and saying something now and then very brief.
Just to please herself she would take a book from
the shelf and stand there, watching her father
write, so equally, so neatly from one side of the
page to another, with a little cough now and then
or something said briefly to the other old gentle-
man opposite. And she thought, standing there
with her book open, one could let whatever one
thought expand here like a leaf in water; and if it
did well here, among the old gentlemen smoking
and [i]The Times[/i] crackling then it was right. And
watching her father as he wrote in his study, she
thought (now sitting in the boat) he was not vain,
nor a tyrant (these were the things they hated him
most for) and did not wish to make you pity him.
Indeed, if he saw she was there, reading a book,
he would ask her, as gently as any one could, Was
there nothing he could give her?

foundly. Annoyed that he did not want anything
of her, Mrs. Ramsay would ask him (Lily could
hear her) wouldn’t he like a coat, a rug, a news-
paper? No, he wanted nothing. (Here he bowed).
There was some quality in her which he did not
much like. It was perhaps her masterfulness, her
positiveness, something matter-of-fact in her. She
was so direct.
   (A noise drew her attention to the drawing-
room window—the squeak of a hinge. The light
breeze was toying with the window.)
   There must have been people who disliked her
very much, Lily thought (Yes; she realised that
the drawing-room step was empty, but it had no
effect on her whatever. She did not want Mrs.
Ramsay now).—People who thought her too sure,
too drastic. Also her beauty offended people
probably. How monotonous, they would say,
and the same always! They preferred another
type—the dark, the vivacious. Then she was
weak with her husband. She let him make those
scenes. Then she was reserved. Nobody knew
exactly what had happened to her. And (to go
back to Mr. Carmichael and his dislike) one
could not imagine Mrs. Ramsay standing paint-
ing, lying reading, a whole morning on the lawn.
It was unthinkable. Without saying a word, the
only token of her errand a basket on her arm, she

were conducting some secret symphony.

   (The sea is without a stain on it, thought Lily
Briscoe, still standing and looking out over the
bay. It isstretched like silk across the bay. And
one cannot see where the sky joins it.Distance
had an extraordinary power; they had been
swallowed up in it, she felt, they were gone for
ever, they had become part of the nature of things.
It was so calm; it was so quiet. The steamer
itself had vanished, but the great scroll of smoke
still hung up in the air and drooped like a flag
mournfully in valediction.)

   It was like that then, the island, thought Cam,
once more drawing her fingers through the waves.
She had never seen it from out at sea before. It
lay like that on the sea, did it, with a dent in the
middle and two sharp crags, and the sea swept in
there, and spread away for miles and miles on
either side of the island. It was very small;
shaped something like a leaf stood on end. So
we took a little boat, she thought, beginning to
tell herself a story of adventure about escaping
291
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and
clutch at them vanishing. Charles Tansley did
that too: it was part of the reason why one dis-
liked him. He upset the proportions of one’s
world. And what had happened to him, she
wondered, idly stirring the plantains with her
brush. He had got his fellowship. He had
married; he lived at Golder’s Green.
   She had gone one day into a Hall and heard
him speaking during the war. He was denouncing
something: he was condemning somebody. He
was preaching brotherly love. And all she felt
was how could he love his kind who did not know
one picture from another, who had stood behind
her smoking shag ("fivepence an ounce, Miss
Briscoe") and making it his business to tell her
wom[e over a]ncan’t write, women can’t paint, not so
much that he believed it, as that for some odd
reason he wished it? There he was lean and red
and raucous, preaching love from a platform
(there were ants crawling about among the
plantains which she disturbed with her brush—red,
energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley).
She had looked at him ironically from her seat in
the half-empty hall, pumping love into that chilly
space, and suddenly, there was the old cask or
whatever it was bobbing up and down among the
waves and Mrs. Ramsay looking for her spectacle

nuisance! Lost again. Don’t bother, Mr.
Tansley. I lose thousands every summer," at
which he pressed his chin back against his collar,
as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but
could stand it in her whom he liked, and smiled
very charmingly. He must have confided in her
on one of those long expeditions when people
got separated and walked back alone. He
was educating his little sister, Mrs. Ramsay had
told her. It was immensely to his credit. Her
own idea of him was grotesque, Lily knew well.
Educating sandy-haired children in some bleak
suburb, vegetarian, austere. Half one’s notions of

They served private

whipping-boy. She found herself flagellating his
lean flanks when she was out of temper. If she
wanted to be serious about him she had to help
herself to Mrs. Ramsay's sayings, to look at him
through her eyes.
   She raised a little mountain for the ants to
climb over. She reduced them to a frenzy of
indecision by this interference in their cosmogony.
Some ran this way, others that.
   One wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with, she
reflected. Fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to
get round that one woman with, she thought.

Among them, must be one that was stone blind
to her beauty. One wanted most some secret
sense, fine as air, with which to steal through
keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting,
talking, sitting silent in the window alone; which
took to itself and treasured up like the air which
held the smoke of the steamer, her thoughts, her
imaginations, her desires. What did the hedge
mean to her, what did the garden mean to
her, what did it mean to her when a wave
broke? (Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs.
Ramsay look up; she too heard a wave falling on
the beach.) And then what stirred and trembled
in her mind when the children cried, "How’s
that? How’s that?" cricketing? She would stop
knitting for a second. She would look intent.
Then she would lapse again, and suddenly Mr.
Ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her.
And what was thecurious shock thatpassed
through her and seemed to rock her in profound
agitation on its breast whenstopping there he stood
over her, looked down at her, and said “Well!”?
   He stretched out his hand and raised her from
her chair. It seemed somehow as if he had done
it before; as if he had once bent in the same way
and raised her from a boat which, lying a few
inches off some island, had required that the ladies
should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen.
306
THE LIGHTHOUSE
An old-fashioned scene that was, which required,
very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers.
Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs. Ramsay
had thought (Lily supposed) the time has come
now. Yes, she would say it now. Yes, she would
marry him. And she stepped slowly, quietly on
shore. Probably she said one word only, letting
her hand rest still in his. l will marry you, she
might have said, with her hand in his; but no
more. Time after time the same thrill had passed
between them—obviously it had, Lily thought,
smoothing a way for her ants. She was not
inventing; she was only trying to smooth out
something she had been given years ago folded
up; something she had seen. For in the rough
and tumble of daily life, with all those children
about, all those visitors, one had constantly a sense
of repetition—of one thing [strike][violet](that bend of his to[/violet][/strike]
[strike][violet]help her to her feet, for instance)[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
falling where
another had fallen, and so setting up an echo
which chimed in the air and made [strike][violet]life then[/violet][/strike]
[violet]it[/violet]
full of
vibrations.
   But it would be a mistake, she thought,
thinking how they walked off together, [strike][violet]she in her[/violet][/strike]

[strike][violet]green shawl, he with his tie flying,[/violet][/strike] arm in arm,
past the greenhouse, to simplify their relationship.
It was no monotony of bliss—she with her
impulses and quicknesses; he with his shudders

and glooms. Oh no. The bedroom door would
slam violently early in the morning. He would
start from the table in a temper. Some [strike][violet]letter or[/violet][/strike]
[violet]bill [%][/violet]
some [strike][violet]article[/violet][/strike]
[violet]letter[/violet]
criticising his books had burst onto his
plate.Then all through the house there would
be a sense of doors slamming andblinds fluttering
as if a gusty wind were blowing and people
scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten
hatches and make things shipshape. She had met
Paul Rayley like that one day on the stairs.They
had laughed and laughed, like a couple of children,
all because Mr. Ramsey, finding a[strike][violet]n[/violet][/strike] earwig in his
[violet][%][/violet]
cup at breakfast had sent the whole thing flying
through the air on to the terrace outside. “An
earwig,” Prue murmured, awestruck, looking with
round eyes. Other people might find centipedes.
But he had built round him such a fence of
sanctity, and occupied the space with such a
demeanour of majesty that a[strike][violet]n[/violet][/strike] earwig in his milk
[violet][%][/violet]
was a monster. Later he met them outside his
study door, took them in, and showed them his
map of the Hebrides. It was a wonderful map.
He was charming, showing them his map. They
forgave him instantly, as indeed he expected to be
forgiven.
   But it tired Mrs. Ramsay, it cowed her a little
—the plates whizzing and the doors slamming.
And there would fall between them sometimes
308
THE LIGHTHOUSE
long rigid silences, when, in a state of mind which
annoyed Lily in her, half plaintive, half resentful,
she seemed unable to surmount the tempest
calmly, or to laugh as they laughed, but in her
weariness perhaps concealed something. She
could not brave another plate in the air or fist on
the table and so hid the letter, said nothing about
the bill ([strike][violet]there was a scene that summer about a[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
[strike][violet]bill for the greenhouse)[/violet][/strike] and brooded and sat
silent. After a time he would hang stealthily
about the places where she was—roaming under
the window where she sat writing letters or
talking, for she would take care to be busy when
he passed, and evade him, and pretend not to see
him. Then he would turn smooth as silk, affable
[[violet]∧] ,/[/violet]
urbane, and try to win her so. Still she would
hold off, and now she would assert for a brief
season some of those prides and airs the due of
her beauty which she was generally utterly with-
out; would turn her head; would look so, over
her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or
William Bankes at her side. At length, standing
outside the group the very figure of a famished
wolfhound (Lily got up off the grass and stood
looking at the steps, at the window, [strike][violet]where she[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
[strike][violet]had seen this[/violet][/strike]), he would say her name, once only,
for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow,
but still she held back; and he would say it once

hingin the tone would
rouse her, and she would go to him, leaving them
all of a sudden, and they would walk off together
among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the
raspberry beds. They would have it out together.
But with what attitudes and with what words?
Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that,
turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide
their curiosity and their discomfort [strike][violet](it was too[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
[strike][violet]private, this, for them to see)[/violet][/strike], and begin picking
flowers, throwing balls, chattering, until it was
time for dinner, and there they were, he at one
end of the table, she at the other, as usual.
   “Why don’t some of you take up botany? . . .
With all those legs and arms why doesn’t one of
you . . .?” So they would talk as usual, laugh-
ing, among the children. All would be as usual,
save only for some quiver, as of a blade in the air,
which came and went between them as if the
usual sight of the children sitting round their
soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after
that hour among the pears and the cabbages.
Especially, Lily thought, Mrs. Ramsay would
glance at Prue. She sat in the middle between
brothers and sisters, always [strike][violet]so[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
occupied, it
seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong [violet][∧][/violet]
[violet]so[/violet]
that she
scarcely spoke herself. How Prue must have
blamed herself for that earwig in the milk! How

white she had gone when Mr. Ramsay threw his
plate through the window! How she drooped
under those long silences between them! Any-
how, her mother now would seem to be making
it up to her;assuring her that everything was
well; promising her that one of these days that
same happiness would be hers. She had enjoyed
it for less than a year, however.
   She had let the flowers fall from her basket,
Lily thought, screwing up her eyes and standing
back as if to look at her picture, which she was
not touching, however, with all her faculties in a
trance, frozen over superficially but moving
underneath with extreme speed.
   She let her flowers fall from her basket,
scattered and tumbled them on to the grass and,
reluctantly and hesitatingly, but without question
or complaint—had she not the faculty of obedience
to perfection?—went too. Down fields, across
valleys, white, flower-strewn—that was how she
would have painted it. The hills were austere.
It was rocky; it was steep. The waves sounded
hoarse on the stones beneath. They went, the
three of them together, Mrs. Ramsay walking
rather fast in front, as if she expected to meet
some one round the corner.
   Suddenly the window at which she was looking
was whitened by some light stuff behind it. At
311
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
last then somebody had come into the drawing-
room; somebody was sitting in the chair. For
Heaven’s sake, she prayed, let them sit still there
and not come floundering out to talk to her.
Mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside;
had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw
an odd-shaped triangular shadow over the step.
It altered the composition of the picture a little.
It was interesting. It might be useful. Her
mood was coming back to her. One must keep
on looking without for a second relaxing the
intensity of emotion, the determination not to be
put off, not to be bamboozled. One must hold
the scene—so—in a vice and let nothing come in
and spoil it. One wanted, she thought, dipping
her brush [strike][violet]in paint slowly[/violet][/strike]
[violet]deliberately[/violet]
, to be on a level with
ordinary experience, to feel simply that’s a chair,
that’s a table, and yet at the same time, It’s a
miracle, it’s an ecstasy. The problem might be
solved after all. Ah, but what had happened?
Some wave of white went over the window pane.
The air must have stirred some flounce in the
room. Her heart leapt at her and seized her and
tortured her.
   “Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!” she cried,
feeling the old horror come back—to want and
want and not to have. Could she inflict that still?
And then, quietly, as if she refrained, that too
312
THE LIGHTHOUSE
became part of ordinary experience, was on a level
with the chair, with the table. Mrs. Ramsay—it
was part of her perfect goodness [strike][violet]to Lily[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
—sat
there quite simply, in the chair, flicked her needles
to and fro, knitted her reddish-brown stocking,
cast her shadow on the step. There she sat.
   And as if she had something she must share,
yet could hardly leave her easel, so full her mind
was of what she was thinking [violet][strike]and doing,[/strike][/violet]
[violet][%][/violet]
Lily
went past Mr. Carmichael holding her brush to
the edge of the lawn. Where was that boat now?
And Mr. Ramsay? She wanted him.
13
   Mr. Ramsay had almost done reading. One
hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness
to turn it the very instant he had finished it. He
sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his
hair about, extraordinarily exposed to everything.
He looked very old. He looked, James thought,
getting his head now against the Lighthouse, now
against the waste of waters running away into the
open, like some old stone lying on the sand; he
looked as if he had become physically what was
always at the back of both of their minds—that
loneliness which was for both of them the truth
about things.
313
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
   He was reading very quickly, as if he were
eager to get to the end. Indeed they were very
close to the Lighthouse now. There it loomed
up, stark and straight, glaring white and black,
and one could see the waves breaking in white
splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks. One
could see lines and creases in the rocks. One
could see the windows clearly; a dab of white on
one of them, and a little tuft of green on the rock.
A man had come out and looked at them through
a glass and gone in again. So it was like that,
James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen
across the bay all these years; it was a stark tower
on a bare rock. It satisfied him. It confirmed
some obscure feeling of his about his own char-
acter. The old ladies, he thought, thinking of the
garden at home, went dragging their chairs about
on the lawn. Old Mrs. Beckwith, for example,
was always saying how nice it was and how sweet
it was and how they ought to be so proud and
they ought to be so happy, but as a matter of fact
James thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood
there on its rock, it’s like that. He looked at his
Father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight.
They sharedthat knowledge. “We are driving
before a gale—we must sink,” he began saying to
himself, half aloud[strike].[/strike][violet][∧][/violet] [strike][violet]That was how[/violet][/strike]
[violet]exactly[/violet]
[violet]as[/violet]
his father
[violet]said[/violet]
[strike][violet]did[/violet][/strike] it
314
THE LIGHTHOUSE
   Nobody seemed to have spoken for an age.
Cam was tired of looking at the sea. Little bits
of black cork had floated past; the fish were dead
in the bottom of the boat. Still her father read,
and James looked at him and she looked at him,
and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to
the death, and he went on reading quite un-
conscious of what they thought. It was thus that
he escaped, she thought. Yes, with his great
forehead and his great nose, holding his little
mottled book firmly in front of him, he escaped.
You might try to lay hands on him, but then like
a bird, he spread his wings, he floated off to settle
out of your reach somewhere far away on some
desolate stump. She gazed at the immense
expanse of the sea. The island had grown so
small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer.
It looked like the top of a rock which some [strike][violet]big[/violet][/strike]
wave [violet][∧][/violet]
[violet]bigger[/violet]
[violet]than[/violet]
[violet]the[/violet]
[violet]rest[/violet]
would cover. Yet in its frailty were all those
paths, those terraces, those [strike][violet]fruit trees[/violet][/strike]
[violet]attics[/violet]
—all those
innumerable things. But as, just before sleep,
things simplify themselves so that only one thing
of all the myriad details [strike][violet]that were crowding in[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
[strike][violet]one’s mind just now[/violet][/strike] has power to assert itself, so,
she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all that
was fading and disappearing, and nothing was
left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically
this way and that across her mind. It was a
315
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
hanging garden; it was a valley, full of birds, and
flowers, and antelopes [strike][violet]and lovely[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
. . . . She was
falling asleep.
   “Come now," said Mr. Ramsay, suddenly
shutting his book.
   Come where? To what extraordinary adven-
ture? She woke with a start. To land somewhere,
to climb somewhere? Where was he leading
them? For after his immense silence the words
startled them. But it was absurd. He was
hungry, he said. It was time for lunch. Besides,
look, he said. There’s the Lighthouse. “We’re
almost there."
   “He’s doing very well," said Macalister,
praising James. “He's keeping her very steady."
   But his father never praised him, James
thought grimly.
   Mr. Ramsay opened the parcel and shared out
the sandwiches among them. Now he was happy,
eating bread and cheese with these fishermen. He
would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge
about in the harbour spitting with the other old
men, James thought, watching him slice his cheese
into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.
   This is right, this is it, Cam kept feeling, as
she peeled her hard-boiled egg. Now she felt as
she did in the study when the old men were
reading [i]The Times[/i]. Now I can go on thinking
316
THE LIGHTHOUSE
whatever I like, and I shan't fall over a precipice
or be drowned, for there he is, keeping his eye on
[strike][violet]all that.[/violet][/strike]
[violet]me[/violet]
   At the same time they were sailing so fast along
by the rocks that it was very exciting—it seemed
as if they had really escaped from a sinking ship,
so that they were doing two things at once; they
were eating their lunch here in the sun and they,
were also making for safety in a great storm.
Would the water last? Would the provisions
last? she asked herself, telling herself a story but
knowing at the same time what was [strike][violet]happening.[/violet][/strike]
[violet]the truth.[/violet]
   They would soon be out of it, Mr. Ramsay was
saying to old Macalister; but their children would
see some strange things. Macalister said he was
seventy-five last March; Mr. Ramsay was
seventy-one. Macalister said he had never seen a
doctor; he had never lost a tooth. And that’s the
way I’d like my children to live—Cam was sure
that her father was thinking that, for he stopped
her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her,
as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how
they live, that if she did not want it she should
put it back in the parcel. She should not waste it.
He said it so wisely, [strike][violet]so justly,[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
as if he knew so well
what went onin the world that she put it back at
once, and then he gave her, from his own parcel,
a gingerbread nut, as if he were a great Spanish

gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lad[∧]

at a window (so courteous his manner was). Buth

e
was shabby, and simple, eating bread and cheese;
and yet he was leading them on a great expedi-
tion where, for all she knew, they would be
drowned.
“That was where she sunk," said Macalister’s
boy suddenly.
[%]
“Three men were drowned where we are
now,”saidthe old man[∧]
said
. He had seen them
clinging to the mast himself. And Mr. Ramsay
taking a look at the spot was about, James and
Cam were afraid, to burst out:
[pencil]10 pt[/pencil]
[ind/]But I beneath a rougher sea,
and if he did, they could not bear it; they would
shriek aloud; they could not endure another
explosion of [strike][violet]that[/violet][/strike]
[violet]the[/violet]
passion that boiled in him; but
to their surprise all he said was “Ah” as if he
thought to himself, But why make a fuss about
that? Naturally men are drowned in a storm, but
it is a perfectly straightforward affair, and the
depths of the sea (he sprinkled the crumbs from
his sandwich paper over them) are only water
after all. Then having lighted his pipe he took
out his watch. He looked at it attentively; he
made, perhaps, some mathematical calculation.
At last he said, triumphantly:
318
THE LIGHTHOUSE
   “Well done!” James had steered them like
born sailor.
   There! Cam thought, addressing herself
silently to James. You've got it at last. For she
knew that this was what James had been wanting,
and she knew that now he had got it he was so
pleased that he would not look at her or at his
father or at any one. There he sat with his hand
on the tiller sitting bolt upright, looking rather
sulky and frowning slightly. He was so pleased
that he was not going to let anybody [strike][violet]take away[/violet][/strike]
[violet]share[/violet]
a
grain of his pleasure. They must think that he
was perfectly indifferent. But you’ve got it now,
Cam thought.
      They had tacked, and they were sailing swiftly,
buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed
them on from one to another with an extraordinary
lilt and exhilaration beside the reef. On the left a
row of rocks showed brown through the water
which thinned and became greener and on one, a
higher rock, a wave incessantly broke and spurted
a little column of drops which fell down in a
shower. One could hear the slap of the water and
the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing
and hissing sound from the waves rolling and
gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were
wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed
and tumbled and sported like this for ever.
319
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
   Now they could see two men on the Lighthouse,
watching them and making ready to meet them.
   Mr. Ramsay buttoned his coat, and turned up
his trousers. He took the large, badly packed,
brown paper parcel which Nancy had got ready
and sat with it on his knee. Thus in complete
readiness to land he sat looking back at the island.
With his long-sighted eyes perhaps he could see
the dwindled leaf-like shape standing on end on a
plate of gold quite clearly. What could he see?
Cam wondered. It was all a blur to her. What
was he thinking now? she wondered. What was
it he sought, so fixedly, so intently, so silently?
They watched him, both of them, sitting bare-
headed with his parcel on his knee staring and
staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like
the vapour of something that had burnt itself
away. What do you want? they both wanted to
ask. They both wanted to say, Ask us anything
and we will give it you. But he did not ask them
anything. He sat and looked at the island and he
might be thinking, We perished, each alone, or
he might be thinking, I have reached it. I have
found it[strike][violet],[/violet][/strike]
[violet];[/violet]
but he said nothing.
   Then he put on his hat.
   “Bring those parcels,” he said, nodding his
head at the things Nancy had done up for them
to take to the Lighthouse. "The parcels for
320
THE LIGHTHOUSE
the Lighthouse men," he said. He rose and
stood in the bow of the boat, very straight
and tall, for all the world, James thought, as
if he were saying, “There is no God,” and
Cam thought, as if he were [strike][violet]jumping[/violet][/strike]
[violet]leaping[/violet]
into
[violet]space[/violet]
[strike][strike]eternity[/strike][/strike], and they both rose to follow him as
he sprung, lightly like a young man, holding
his parcel, on to the rock.
14
“He must have reached it,” said Lily Briscoe
aloud, feeling suddenly completely tired out. For
the Lighthouse had become almost invisible, had
melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of
looking at it and the effort of thinking of him
landing there, which both seemed to be one and
the same effort, had stretched her body and mind
to the utmost. Ah, but she was relieved. What-
ever she had wanted to give him, when he left her
that morning, she had given him at last.
“He has landed,” she said aloud. "It is
finished." Then, surging up, puffing slightly, old
Mr. Carmichael stood beside her, looking like an
old pagan God, shaggy, with weeds in his hair
and the trident (it was only a French novel) in his
hand. He stood by her on the edge of the lawn,
swaying a little in his bulk and said, shading his
321
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
eyes with his hand: “They will have landed,”
and she felt that she had been right. [strike][violet]He said[/violet][/strike]
[violet][%][/violet]
[strike][violet]exactly what she had said[/violet][/strike].They had not needed
to speak. They had been thinking the same
things and he had answered her without her
asking him anything. He stood there [violet][∧][/violet]
[violet]as if[/violet]
[violet]he[/violet]
[violet]were[/violet]
spreading
his hands over all the weakness and suffering of
mankind; she thought he was surveying, toler-
antly, [violet][∧][/violet]
[violet]and[/violet]
compassionately, their final destiny. Now
he has crowned the occasion, she thought, when
his hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let
fall from his great height a wreath of violets and
asphodels which, fluttering slowly, lay at length
upon the earth.
   Quickly, as if she were recalled by something
over there, she turned to her canvas. There it was
—her picture. Yes, with all its green and blues,
its lines running up and across, its attempt at
something. It would be hung in the attics, she
thought; it would be destroyed. But what did
that matter? she asked herself, taking up her
brush again. She looked at the steps; they were
empty; she looked at her canvas; it was blurred.
With a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a
second, she drew a line there, in the centre. It
was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought,
laying down her brush [violet][∧][/violet]
[violet]in extreme[/violet]
[violet]fatigue[/violet]
, I have had my vision.
